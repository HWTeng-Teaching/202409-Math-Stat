Drew's scheme doesn't increase his chances of leaving since theres a 1/3 chance that the teacher is going to name one of the boys in the first place.

## Prove

Consider a Bernoulli trial, which is a random experiment with only two possible outcomes: success (with probability p) and failure (with probability 1 - p). Based on the Bernoulli trial, let & be a Bernoulli random
variable, where X(sucess) = 1, i.e., X maps success to 1 and (failure) = 0
, i.e., X maps failure to 0. In other words, X - 1 represents a success, and
X = 0 represents a failure.
Define the probability mass function (pmf) of X, i.e., write P(X = x) for all
possible values of x.


P(X=1) = p, it means probability of success.

P(X=0) = 1 - p,  means probability of failure.

P(X=x) = 0, for x is not 1 or 0,  means probability of other outcome is 0.
