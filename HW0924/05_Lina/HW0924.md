### Problem 47: Two Urns Problem

Urn A contains 4 red, 3 blue, and 2 green balls. Urn B contains 2 red, 3 blue, and 4 green balls. A ball is drawn from Urn A and placed into Urn B, then a ball is drawn from Urn B.

#### (a) What is the probability that a red ball is drawn from Urn B?
Let's use the the total probability law
Let $R_A$ and $R_B$ denote the events that a red ball is drawn from urn A and from urn B, respectively
$P(R_B) = P(R_B | R_A)P(R_B) + P(R_B | bORg)P(R_B) = \dfrac{4}{9}  \cdot \dfrac{3}{10} + \dfrac{5}{9}  \cdot \dfrac{2}{10} = \dfrac{11}{45}$


#### (b) If a red ball is drawn from Urn B, what is the probability that a red ball was drawn from Urn A?

Let's find $P(R_A | R_B)$. By definition,  
$P(R_A | R_B) = \dfrac{P(R_A \cap R_B)}{P(R_B)} = \dfrac{\dfrac{4}{9}  \cdot \dfrac{3}{10}}{\dfrac{11}{45}} = \dfrac{6}{11}$

### Problem 49: Fair Coin Tossed Three Times

#### (a) What is the probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one head?

Let $A =$ event of getting two or more heads, and $B =$ event of getting at least one head. We need to find $P(A | B)$.

The sample space for three coin tosses is:
S = $\{ (H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (H, T, T), (T, H, H), (T, H, T), (T, T, H), (T, T, T) \}$

The events:
- $A = \{ (H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (T, H, H) \}$
- $B = \{ (H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (H, T, T), (T, H, H), (T, H, T), (T, T, H) \}$

Now:
$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$

Since $A \subseteq B$:
$P(A | B) = \frac{4/8}{7/8}$ = \frac{4}{7}$


### Problem 58: Probability Scheme

A teacher randomly chooses two students to stay after school, and one to leave, using a three-sided die. Drew's plan involves asking the teacher to reveal the name of one person who will stay.

Drew thinks that after knowing one person who stays, his probability of leaving increases from $\frac{1}{3}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$. However, this reasoning is flawed because the teacher's information does not change the original probabilities — the outcome is still based on the teacher's random decision using the die.

Thus, Drew's probability of leaving remains $\frac{1}{3}$, even after knowing the name of one person who will stay.

#### (b) What is the probability given that there was at least one tail?

The calculation here follows the same logic as the coin problem earlier — you adjust the sample space based on the conditional information provided.

### Problem 74: System Reliability Problem

What is the probability that the system works if each unit fails independently with probability $p$?

Given that each part of the system operates independently, the system works when either the top or the bottom path functions. Assuming independence, the probability that each unit works is $(1 - p)$.

Let $P_{\text{system}}$ be the probability that the system works. We compute this by considering the top and bottom paths.

### Problem 77: Hitting the Bull's-eye

The probability of hitting the bull's-eye at least once is $1 - P(\text{miss every time})$. Let the probability of hitting the bull's-eye in a single trial be $0.05$. The probability of missing in one trial is $0.95$.

If the player throws $n$ times, the probability of missing all trials is:
$$
P(\text{miss every time}) = 0.95^n
$$

We want this to be $0.5$, so we solve:
$$
0.95^n = 0.5
$$
Taking the natural logarithm:
$$
n \ln(0.95) = \ln(0.5)
$$
$$
n = \frac{\ln(0.5)}{\ln(0.95)} \approx 13.51
$$

Thus, the player should throw approximately 14 times.

### Problem Q6: Bernoulli Trial PMF

Let $X$ be a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p$. The probability mass function (pmf) of $X$ is:

$$
P(X = x) = \begin{cases} 
p & \text{if } x = 1 \\
1 - p & \text{if } x = 0
\end{cases}
$$

### Problem 2: Fair Coin Tossed Four Times

#### (a) Frequency Function for Number of Heads Before First Tail

To find the frequency function for the number of heads before the first tail, note that heads occur until the first tail appears. The possible outcomes are:

- 0 heads before first tail: $(T, \dots)$
- 1 head before first tail: $(H, T, \dots)$
- 2 heads before first tail: $(H, H, T, \dots)$
- 3 heads before first tail: $(H, H, H, T)$

The probabilities can be computed accordingly.

#### (b) Number of Heads After First Tail

Similar to part (a), we count the heads that occur after the first tail.

#### (c) Number of Heads Minus Number of Tails

This random variable tracks the difference between heads and tails in the coin tosses.

#### (d) Number of Tails Times Number of Heads

This random variable multiplies the counts of tails and heads across the trials.
