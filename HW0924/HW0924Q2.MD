49. A fair coin is tossed three times.

a. What is the probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one
head?

b. What is the probability given that there was at least one tail?


### Answers

a.   
   p(x = 2 , 3 | X >=1 ) = (p(3) + p(2))/P(X>=1) =1/2 / (7/8) = 
   
   $$
  ans :  \frac{4}{7} 
   $$
  
b.  
   p(x >= 1) = 1 - p(0) = 7/8 = 1 - the probability that there was no tail

At part (b):

P(At least one tail) = 7/8.

P(Two heads) = 3/8.

So P(Two heads | At least one tail) = 3/7
