### Step 1: Probability that the player can hit the bull's-eye on each trial

$$
P(\text{the player can hit the bull's eye on each trial}) = 0.05
$$

### Step 2: Probability that the player can hit the bull's-eye at least once

$$
P( \text{the player can hit the bull's-eye at least once} ) = 1 - P( \text{the player can't hit the bull's-eye at all in } n \text{ trials} ) \geq 0.5
$$

### Step 3: Probability that the player can't hit the bull's-eye at all in n trials

$$
P(\text{the player can't hit the bull's-eye at all in } n \text{ trials}) = \left[1 - P(\text{the player can hit the bull's-eye on each trial})\right]^n = (1 - 0.05)^n = 0.95^n
$$

### Step 4: Combine Step 3 and Step 4

$$
P(\text{the player can't hit the bull's-eye at all in } n \text{ trials}) = 0.95^n \leq 0.5
$$

### Step 5: Find n

$$
\begin{align*}
0.95^n \leq 0.5 \\
\log(0.95^n) \leq \log(0.5) \\
nlog(0.95) \leq \log(0.5) \\
n  \geq \frac{\log(0.5)}{\log(0.95)} \approx \frac{-0.3010}{-0.0223} \approx 13.5 \\
\therefore   n = 14
\end{align*}
$$

### Final Answer
Thus, the player should throw 14 times so that his probability of hitting the bull's-eye at least once is 0.5.
