### Solution

#### About the system

1. For the series path to work, all components inside must be normal.
2. For parallel paths to work, at least one of the paths must work properly.

#### Step 1: Probability that the first and third paths will not work
According to the problem, we can know the probability that each unit fails independently is p, so the probability that the first path doesn't work is

$$
P(\text{the first path won't work}) = P(\text{the third path won't work}) = 1-P(\text{the path will work}) = 1-(1-p)^2
$$

#### Step 2: Probability that the second path will not work 

$$
P(\text{the second path won't work}) = p
$$

#### Step 3: Probability that the system will work
As mentioned earlier, for this parallel system to operate, at least one of the first to third paths must be able to operate, so

$$
P(the system will work) = P(1-\text{the system won't work}) = 1-(1-(1-p)^2)*p*(1-(1-p)^2)
$$

### Final Answer
Thus, the probability that the system works is 

$$
1-(1-(1-p)^2)*p*(1-(1-p)^2)
$$
