### Problem Breakdown

We are given a system consisting of five units, each of which fails independently with probability \( p \). We are tasked with finding the probability that the system works.

The diagram shows a network with two parallel paths, each consisting of three units in series.

### Key Concepts

1. **Series System**: For a series system, the system works only if all components work. The probability that a system of \( n \) components in series works is:
   \[
   P(\text{Series}) = (1 - p)^n
   \]
   where \( p \) is the failure probability of each component.

2. **Parallel System**: For a parallel system, the system works if at least one of the paths works. The probability that a system of \( n \) components in parallel works is:
   \[
   P(\text{Parallel}) = 1 - P(\text{All paths fail})
   \]
   For two paths, this is:
   \[
   P(\text{Parallel}) = 1 - P(\text{First path fails}) \times P(\text{Second path fails})
   \]

### Solution

#### Step 1: Probability for a Single Series Path
Each of the two paths has three components in series. The probability that one path works is the probability that all three components work, which is:
\[
P(\text{Series path works}) = (1 - p)^3
\]

#### Step 2: Probability that Both Paths Fail
The system will fail only if both paths fail. The probability that a path fails is:
\[
P(\text{Path fails}) = 1 - P(\text{Path works}) = 1 - (1 - p)^3
\]
Thus, the probability that both paths fail is:
\[
P(\text{Both paths fail}) = \left(1 - (1 - p)^3\right)^2
\]

#### Step 3: Probability that the System Works
The probability that the system works is the complement of the probability that both paths fail:
\[
P(\text{System works}) = 1 - P(\text{Both paths fail}) = 1 - \left(1 - (1 - p)^3\right)^2
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the probability that the system works is:
\[
P(\text{System works}) = 1 - \left(1 - (1 - p)^3\right)^2
\]
