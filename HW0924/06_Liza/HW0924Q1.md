## Question 1
Urn A has four red, three blue, and two green balls. Urn B has two red, three
blue, and four green balls. A ball is drawn from urn A and put into urn B, and
then a ball is drawn from urn B.  
**a.**  What is the probability that a red ball is drawn from urn B?  
**b.**  If a red ball is drawn from urn B, what is the probability that a red ball was
drawn from urn A?

## Solution
Let $R_A$ and $R_B$ denote the events that a red ball is drawn from urn A and from urn B, respectively, using the law of
total probability
$P(R_B) = P(R_B | R_A)P(R_B) + P(R_B | blue or green)P(R_B) = 4/9 × 3/10 + 5/9 × 2/10 = 11/24$
