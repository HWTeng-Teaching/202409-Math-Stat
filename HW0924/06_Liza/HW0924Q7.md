## Question 7
An experiment consists of throwing a fair coin four times. Find the frequency
function and the cumulative distribution function of the following random variables:  
(a) the number of heads before the first tail,  
(b) the number of heads
following the first tail,  
(c) the number of heads minus the number of tails, and  
(d) the number of tails times the number of heads.

## Solution 
Let $X_a$ be the random variable representing the number of heads before the first tail.   
Let $X_b$ be the random variable representing the number of heads following the first tail.   
Let $X_c$ be the random variable representing the number of heads minus the number of tails.   
Let $X_d$ be the random variable representing the number of tails times the number of heads.   

Let's consider all posible outcomes and possible values of random variables respectively  
Outcomes  $X_a$  $X_b$  $X_c$  $X_d$  
HHHH        4      0      4      0  
HHHT        3      0        2      3  
HHTH        2      1      2       3  
HHTT        2      0    0        4  
HTHH        1      2 2 3  
HTHT        1      1  0  4  
HTTH        1      1  0  4  
HTTT        1      0  -2  3  
THHH        0      3  2  3    
THHT        0      2  0  4  
THTH        0      2  0  4  
THTT        0      1  -2  3  
TTHH        0      2     0  4  
TTHT        0      1  -2  3  
TTTH        0      1  -2  3  
TTTT        0      0  -4  0  

Therefore,  
P($X_a$ = 4) = 1/16  
P($X_a$ = 3) = 1/16  
P($X_a$ = 2) = 2/16 = 1/8  
P($X_a$ = 1) = 4/16 = 1/4  
P($X_a$ = 0) = 8/16 = 1/2  

F($X_a$ = 4) = 1  
F($X_a$ = 3) = 15/16  
F($X_a$ = 2) = 14/16 = 7/8  
F($X_a$ = 1) = 12/16 = 3/4  
F($X_a$ = 0) = 8/16 = 1/2  

P($X_b$ = 3) = 1/16  
P($X_b$ = 2) = 4/16 = 1/4  
P($X_b$ = 1) = 6/16 = 3/8  
P($X_b$ = 0) = 5/16  

F($X_b$ = 3) = 1  
F($X_b$ = 2) = 15/16  
F($X_b$ = 1) = 11/16   
F($X_b$ = 0) = 5/16  

P($X_c$ = 4) = 1/16  
P($X_c$ = 2) = 4/16 = 1/4    
P($X_c$ = 0) = 6/16 = 3/8  
P($X_c$ = -2) = 4/16 = 1/4  
P($X_c$ = -4) = 1/16   

F($X_c$ = 4) = 1  
F($X_c$ = 2) = 15/16  
F($X_c$ = 0) = 11/16  
F($X_c$ = -2) = 5/16    
F($X_c$ = -4) = 1/16    

P($X_c$ = 4) = 2/16 = 1/8    
P($X_c$ = 3) = 8/16 = 1/2    
P($X_c$ = 0) = 6/16 = 3/8    

F($X_c$ = 4) = 1  
F($X_c$ = 3) = 14/16 = 7/8    
F($X_c$ = 0) = 6/16 = 3/8
