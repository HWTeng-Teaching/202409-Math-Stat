## Solution 
Let A be the event that the top brach works, B be the event that the center branch works, and C the event that the lower branch works. We want P(A ∪ B ∪ C)  

$P(A ∪ B ∪ C) = 1 - P(A' \cap B' \cap C') = 1 - P(A') P(B') P(C') = 1 - (1 - (1-p)^2)  \cdot  p \cdot (1 - (1-p)^2) = 1 - p^3 \cdot (2-p)^2$
