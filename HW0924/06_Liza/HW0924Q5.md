## Question 5
A player throws darts at a target. On each trial, independently of the other trials,
he hits the bull’s-eye with probability .05. How many times should he throw so
that his probability of hitting the bull’s-eye at least once is .5?

## Solution 
$P(miss \\ bull's-eyes \\ in \\ each \\ of \\ n \\ throws) = 0.95^n$ 
<br>
$P(hit \\ bull's-eyes \\ at \\ least \\ once \\ in \\ n \\ throws) = 1 - 0.95^n$ 
<br>
$1 - 0.95^n = 0.5 $
<br>
Therefore n = 13.5 
Therefore, since n is an integer, he needs at least 14 throws.
