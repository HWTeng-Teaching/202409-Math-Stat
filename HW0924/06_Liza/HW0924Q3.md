## Question 3
A teacher tells three boys, Drew, Chris, and Jason, that two of them will have
to stay after school to help her clean erasers and that one of them will be able to
leave. She further says that she has made the decision as to who will leave and who
will stay at random by rolling a special three-sided Dungeons and Dragons die.
Drew wants to leave to play soccer and has a clever idea about how to increase his
chances of doing so. He figures that one of Jason and Chris will certainly stay and
asks the teacher to tell him the name of one of the two who will stay. Drew’s idea
is that if, for example, Jason is named, then he and Chris are left and they each
have a probability .5 of leaving; similarly, if Chris is named, Drew’s probability
of leaving is still .5. Thus, by merely asking the teacher a question, Drew will
increase his probability of leaving from $\dfrac{1}{3}$ to $\dfrac{1}{2}$. What do you think of this scheme?
