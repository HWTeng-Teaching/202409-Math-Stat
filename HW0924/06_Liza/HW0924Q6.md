## Question 6
 Consider a Bernoulli trial, which is a random experiment with only two possible outcomes: success (with probability $p$) and failure (with probability $1-p$). Based on the Bernoulli trial, let $X$ be a Bernoulli random variable, where $X(sucess)=1$, i.e., $X$ maps success to 1 and $X(failure)=0$, i.e., $X$ maps failure to 0. In other words, $X=1$ represents a success, and $X=0$ represents a failure. <br> Define the probability mass function (pmf) of $X$, i.e., write $P(X=x)$ for all possible values of $x$.

 ## Solution
$P(X = k) = p$, if k = 1  
$P(X = k) = 1-p$, if k = 0  
$P(X = k) = 0$, otherwise
