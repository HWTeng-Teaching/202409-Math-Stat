## Question 2
A fair coin is tossed three times.
**a.** What is the probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one
head?
**b.** What is the probability given that there was at least one tail?

## Solution
$P(two \\ or \\ more \\ heads \\ | \\ at \\ least \\ one \\ head) \\ = \\ P(two \\ or \\ more \\ heads \cap at \\ least \\ one \\ head)  \\ \backslash \\ P(at \\ least \\ one \\ head)$

The event that during tossing three times at least one head is recorded is the subset of $\Omega$ denoted by  

<div align="center">
<i>{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH}</i>
</div>  
<br>
So, there are 7 outcomes with at least one head.  
The event that during tossing three times at least two heads is recorded is the subset of $\Omega$ denoted by  

<div align="center">
<i>{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}</i>
</div>  
<br>

So, there are 4 outcomes with two or more heads.
Therefore,  
$P(two \\ or \\ more \\ heads \\ | \\ at \\ least \\ one \\ head) = \dfrac{\dfrac{4}{8}}{\dfrac{7}{8}} = \dfrac{4}{7}$
