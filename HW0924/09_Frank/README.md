### Solution
#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B})$ =
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
$4 \over 9$ * $3 \over 10$ + $5 \over 9$ * $2 \over 10$ = $11 \over 45$

#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B|a red ball was drawn from urn A})$ = 
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) \over P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
\frac{\{frac{4}{9} * \frac{3}{10}}{\frac{4}{9} * \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{9} * \frac{2}{10}}

\[
\frac{\frac{4}{9} + \frac{4}{9}}{12 + \frac{3}{43}}
\]
