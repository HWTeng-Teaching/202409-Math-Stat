### Solution
#### a.
$$
P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B}) = P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})
$$
P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B}) = $4 \over 9$
