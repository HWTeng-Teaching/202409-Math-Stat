### Solution
#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B})$ = $P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) \times P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls})$ + $P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) \times P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ = 

$\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}$ + $\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}$ = $\frac{11}{45}$
#### b.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B|a red ball was drawn from urn A})$ = 
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) \over P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
$\frac{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}}{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{9} \times \frac{2}{10}}$ = $6 \over 11$
