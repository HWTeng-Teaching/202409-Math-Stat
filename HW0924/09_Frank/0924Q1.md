### Q1
### Question
### Solution
#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B})$ = $P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) \times P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls})$ + $P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) \times P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ = 

$\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}$ + $\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}$ = $\frac{11}{45}$
#### b.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B|a red ball was drawn from urn A})$ = 
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) \over P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
$\frac{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}}{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{9} \times \frac{2}{10}}$ = $6 \over 11$
### Q2
### Question
A fair coin is tossed three times.
a. What is the probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one
head?
b. What is the probability given that there was at least one tail?
### Solution
a.   
$P(X \le 2)$ = P(3) + P(2) = $\frac{1}{2}^3 + 3 * \frac{1}{2}^3 = \frac{1}{2}$   

b. 
$P(X \le 2)$ = $1 - P(\phi)$ = $\frac{7}{8}$
   
### Q3
### Question
If we analyze the situation, there should be three scenarios:
   - **Scenario 1**: Chris and Jason stays - teacher can name either Chris or Jason.
   - **Scenario 2**: Chris and Drew stays - teacher will name Chris.
   - **Scenario 3**: Jason and Drew stays - teacher will name Jason.

The three scenarios have same probability, $1 \over 3$. 

Drew's plan effectively changes the perceived probability but does not alter the underlying randomness of the teacher's original choice.
