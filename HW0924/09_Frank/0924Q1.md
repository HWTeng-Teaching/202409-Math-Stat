### Q1
### Question
### Solution
#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B})$ = $P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) \times P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls})$ + $P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) \times P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ = 

$\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}$ + $\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}$ = $\frac{11}{45}$
#### b.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B|a red ball was drawn from urn A})$ = 
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) \over P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
$\frac{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}}{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{9} \times \frac{2}{10}}$ = $6 \over 11$
### Q2
### Question
A fair coin is tossed three times.
a. What is the probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one
head?
b. What is the probability given that there was at least one tail?
### Solution
a.   
$P(X \le 2)$ = P(3) + P(2) = $\frac{1}{2}^3 + 3 * \frac{1}{2}^3 = \frac{1}{2}$   

b. 
$P(X \le 2)$ = $1 - P(\phi)$ = $\frac{7}{8}$
   
### Q3
### Solution
If we analyze the situation, there should be three scenarios:
   - **Scenario 1**: Chris and Jason stays - teacher can name either Chris or Jason.
   - **Scenario 2**: Chris and Drew stays - teacher will name Chris.
   - **Scenario 3**: Jason and Drew stays - teacher will name Jason.

The three scenarios have same probability, $1 \over 3$. 

Drew's plan effectively changes the perceived probability but does not alter the underlying randomness of the teacher's original choice.
### Q4
### Question
### Solution
P(unit works) = 1 - P(unit doesn't work)  
for top and buttom path, P(path works)= $$(1-p)^2$$ => P(path doesn't work) = 1- $$(1-p)^2$$

medium path  P(not work) = p  
P(system doesn't work) = $$(1-(1-p)^2)^2\*p$$

=> P(system works) = 1- $$(1-(1-p)^2)^2\*p$$
### Q5
### Question
A player throws darts at a target. On each trial, independently of the other trials,
he hits the bull’s-eye with probability 0.05. How many times should he throw so
that his probability of hitting the bull’s-eye at least once is 0.5?
### Solution
P(hit) = 0.05 P(miss)= 0.95 P(not hit the bull's eye in n trials)= $$(o.95)^n$$  
for the P(hit the bull's eye in n trials) be more than 0.5, P(not hit the bull's eye for n trials) should be less than 0.5  
P(not hit the bull's eye for n trials)≦0.5 => $$0.95^n$$≦0.5 => n(log0.95)≦log0.5  
$\frac{log0.5}{log0.95} \le n$ =>　13.51 $\le$ n 

=> 14 times
### Q6
### Question
Consider a Bernoulli trial, which is a random experiment with only two possible outcomes: success (with probability $p$) and failure (with probability $1-p$). Based on the Bernoulli trial, let $X$ be a Bernoulli random variable, where $X(sucess)=1$, i.e., $X$ maps success to 1 and $X(failure)=0$, i.e., $X$ maps failure to 0. In other words, $X=1$ represents a success, and $X=0$ represents a failure. <br> Define the probability mass function (pmf) of $X$, i.e., write $P(X=x)$ for all possible values of $x$.
### Solution
P(X=1) = p

P(X=0) = 1-p

P($X \ne 0$, $X \ne 1$) = 0
