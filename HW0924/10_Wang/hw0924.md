### CH01.47
#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B})$ =
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
$4 \over 9$ * $3 \over 10$ + $5 \over 9$ * $2 \over 10$ = $11 \over 45$

#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B|a red ball was drawn from urn A})$ = 
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) \over P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
$\frac{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}}{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{9} \times \frac{2}{10}}$ = $6 \over 11$


### CH01.49

49. A fair coin is tossed three times.

a. What is the probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one
head?

b. What is the probability given that there was at least one tail?


### Answers

a.   
   $P(\text{X >= 2})$ = p(3) + p(2) = $\frac{1}{2}^3 + 3 * \frac{1}{2}^3 = \frac{1}{2} $
  
b.  
   $P(\text{X >= 1})$ = 1 - p(0) = $\frac{7}{8}$
