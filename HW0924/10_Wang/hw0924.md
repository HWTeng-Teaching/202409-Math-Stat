### CH01.47
#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B})$ =
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
$4 \over 9$ * $3 \over 10$ + $5 \over 9$ * $2 \over 10$ = $11 \over 45$

#### a.
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B|a red ball was drawn from urn A})$ = 
$P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) \over P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of three red balls}) + P(\text{a non-red ball is drawn from urn A}) * P(\text{a red ball is drawn from urn B while it constist of two red balls})$ =
$\frac{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10}}{\frac{4}{9} \times \frac{3}{10} + \frac{5}{9} \times \frac{2}{10}}$ = $6 \over 11$


### CH01.49

49. A fair coin is tossed three times.

a. What is the probability of two or more heads given that there was at least one
head?

b. What is the probability given that there was at least one tail?


### Answers

a.   
   $P(\text{X >= 2})$ = p(3) + p(2) = $\frac{1}{2}^3 + 3 * \frac{1}{2}^3 = \frac{1}{2} $
  
b.  
   $P(\text{X >= 1})$ = 1 - p(0) = $\frac{7}{8}$

### ch01.58

### Calculating Actual Probabilities

If we analyze the situation:

1. **Three Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: Drew stays (probability \( \frac{1}{3} \)) - teacher can name either Chris or Jason.
   - **Case 2**: Chris stays (probability \( \frac{1}{3} \)) - teacher will name Jason.
   - **Case 3**: Jason stays (probability \( \frac{1}{3} \)) - teacher will name Chris.

2. **Conditional Outcomes**:
   - If the teacher names Jason, Drew's probability of leaving is still \( \frac{1}{3} \) because the outcome is dependent on the original die roll.
   - If the teacher names Chris, Drew's probability of leaving remains \( \frac{1}{3} \) as well.

Drew's plan effectively changes the perceived probability but does not alter the underlying randomness of the teacher's original choice.

### ch01.74
$ans = the working probability of the top road + the working probability of the middle road + the working probability of the bottom road =
\frac{1}{3} * (1-p)^2 + \frac{1}{3} * (1-p)^2 + \frac{1}{3}$

### ch01.77

suppose n is the time the player throws , p(x >= 1) means the probability the player hit the bull's eyes at least on time when the player throw n times:

p(x >= 1) = 1 - $(1 - 0.05)^n$ > 0.5

0.5 > $(1 - 0.05)^n$

ln(0.5) < n * ln(0.95)

n > 13.51

n is at least 14

ans : 14

### 0924q6
### Probability Mass Function of a Bernoulli Random Variable

- **\( P(X = 1) = p \)**: This means that the probability of success (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 1) is \( p \).

- **\( P(X = 0) = 1 - p \)**: This indicates that the probability of failure (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 0) is \( 1 - p \), which is the complement of the probability of success.

- **\( P(X = x) = 0 \)** for any other values of \( x \): This part states that the random variable \( X \) cannot take any values other than 0 or 1; thus, the probability for any other outcome is zero.
