## Part (a): Marginal Frequency Functions of $X$ and $Y$

1. **Marginal Frequency of $X$:**  
   The marginal frequency function of $X$, denoted $P(X = x)$, is found by summing over all possible values of $Y$ for each fixed $x$.

   - $P(X = 1) = 0.10 + 0.05 + 0.02 + 0.02 = 0.19$
   - $P(X = 2) = 0.05 + 0.20 + 0.05 + 0.02 = 0.32$
   - $P(X = 3) = 0.02 + 0.05 + 0.20 + 0.04 = 0.31$
   - $P(X = 4) = 0.02 + 0.02 + 0.04 + 0.10 = 0.18$

2. **Marginal Frequency of \( Y \):**  
   The marginal frequency function of \( Y \), denoted \( P(Y = y) \), is found by summing over all possible values of \( X \) for each fixed \( y \).

   - $P(Y = 1) = 0.10 + 0.05 + 0.02 + 0.02 = 0.19$
   - $P(Y = 2) = 0.05 + 0.20 + 0.05 + 0.02 = 0.32$
   - $P(Y = 3) = 0.02 + 0.05 + 0.20 + 0.04 = 0.31$
   - $P(Y = 4) = 0.02 + 0.02 + 0.04 + 0.10 = 0.18$

Thus, the marginal distributions are:
- $P(X = 1) = 0.19$, $P(X = 2) = 0.32$, $P(X = 3) = 0.31$, $P(X = 4) = 0.18$.
- $P(Y = 1) = 0.19$, $P(Y = 2) = 0.32$, $P(Y = 3) = 0.31$, $P(Y = 4) = 0.18$.

## Part (b): Conditional Frequency Function

1. **Conditional Frequency Function of $X$ Given $Y = 1$:**  
   We need to calculate $P(X = x | Y = 1)$ for $x = 1, 2, 3, 4$.

   Using the conditional probability formula:

   $$
   P(X = x | Y = 1) = \frac{P(X = x, Y = 1)}{P(Y = 1)}
   $$

   We already calculated \( P(Y = 1) = 0.19 \).

   - $P(X = 1 | Y = 1) = \frac{0.10}{0.19} \approx 0.5263$
   - $P(X = 2 | Y = 1) = \frac{0.05}{0.19} \approx 0.2632$
   - $P(X = 3 | Y = 1) = \frac{0.02}{0.19} \approx 0.1053$
   - $P(X = 4 | Y = 1) = \frac{0.02}{0.19} \approx 0.1053$

1. **Conditional Frequency Function of $Y$ Given $X = 1$:**  
   We need to calculate $P(Y = y | X = 1)$ for $y = 1, 2, 3, 4$.

   Using the conditional probability formula:

   $$
   P(Y = y | X = 1) = \frac{P(X = 1, Y = y)}{P(X = 1)}
   $$

   We already calculated $P(X = 1) = 0.19$.

   - $P(Y = 1 | X = 1) = \frac{0.10}{0.19} \approx 0.5263$
   - $P(Y = 2 | X = 1) = \frac{0.05}{0.19} \approx 0.2632$
   - $P(Y = 3 | X = 1) = \frac{0.02}{0.19} \approx 0.1053$
   - $P(Y = 4 | X = 1) = \frac{0.02}{0.19} \approx 0.1053$

## Summary of Results

- **Marginal Frequency Functions:**
  - $P(X = 1) = 0.19$, $P(X = 2) = 0.32$, $P(X = 3) = 0.31$, $P(X = 4) = 0.18$.
  - $P(Y = 1) = 0.19$, $P(Y = 2) = 0.32$, $P(Y = 3) = 0.31$, $P(Y = 4) = 0.18$.

- **Conditional Frequency Function of $X$ Given $Y = 1$:**
  - $P(X = 1 | Y = 1) \approx 0.5263$
  - $P(X = 2 | Y = 1) \approx 0.2632$
  - $P(X = 3 | Y = 1) \approx 0.1053$
  - $P(X = 4 | Y = 1) \approx 0.1053$

- **Conditional Frequency Function of $Y$ Given $X = 1$:**
  - $P(Y = 1 | X = 1) \approx 0.5263$
  - $P(Y = 2 | X = 1) \approx 0.2632$
  - $P(Y = 3 | X = 1) \approx 0.1053$
  - $P(Y = 4 | X = 1) \approx 0.1053$
 

# Q2

Given the joint density of $X$ and $Y$:

$$
f(x, y) = \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1, \quad 0 \leq y \leq 1
$$

### Part (a): Find the Probabilities

1. **Find $P(X > Y)$:**

   To calculate $P(X > Y)$, we integrate over the region where $X > Y$, that is, the triangular region where $y < x \leq 1$:

   $P(X > Y) = \int_0^1 \int_0^x \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2 \, dy \, dx$

   **Solution for inner integral (over $y$):**

   $\int_0^x \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2 \, dy = \frac{6}{7} \int_0^x (x + y)^2 \, dy$

   Expanding and integrating term by term:

   $\frac{6}{7} \left[ x^2 y + 2xy^2 + \frac{y^3}{3} \right]_0^x = \frac{6}{7} \left( x^3 + 2x^3 + \frac{x^3}{3} \right) = \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{10x^3}{3} = \frac{20x^3}{7}$

   **Now integrate with respect to $x$:**

   $\int_0^1 \frac{20x^3}{7} \, dx = \frac{20}{7} \cdot \frac{x^4}{4} \Big|_0^1 = \frac{20}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{5}{7}$

   So, $P(X > Y) = \frac{5}{7}$.

1. **Find $P(X + Y \leq 1)$:**

   To calculate $P(X + Y \leq 1)$, we integrate over the region where $x + y \leq 1$, which is the triangular region with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, and $(0, 1)$:

   $P(X + Y \leq 1) = \int_0^1 \int_0^{1 - x} \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2 \, dy \, dx$

   **Solution for inner integral (over $y$):**

   $\int_0^{1 - x} \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2 \, dy$

   Expanding and integrating term by term, similar to the previous part, yields a result for this integral, which can then be integrated over $x$.

3. **Find $P(X \leq \frac{1}{2})$:**

   To calculate $P(X \leq \frac{1}{2})$, we integrate over the region $0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2}$ and $0 \leq y \leq 1$:

   $P\left(X \leq \frac{1}{2}\right) = \int_0^{\frac{1}{2}} \int_0^1 \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2 \, dy \, dx$

   **Solution for inner integral (over $y$):**

   $\int_0^1 \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2 \, dy$

   Solving this integral as we did before and then integrating with respect to $x$ over $\left[0, \frac{1}{2}\right]$ gives the result.

### Part (b): Marginal Densities of $X$ and $Y$

1. **Marginal Density of $X$:**

   The marginal density of $X$, $f_X(x)$, is found by integrating out $y$:

   $f_X(x) = \int_0^1 f(x, y) \, dy = \int_0^1 \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2 \, dy$

   Solving this integral yields $f_X(x)$.

3. **Marginal Density of $Y$:**

   Similarly, the marginal density of $Y$, $f_Y(y)$, is found by integrating out $x$:

   $f_Y(y) = \int_0^1 f(x, y) \, dx = \int_0^1 \frac{6}{7} (x + y)^2 \, dx$

   Solving this integral yields $f_Y(y)$.

### Part (c): Conditional Densities

1. **Conditional Density of $X$ given $Y = y$:**

   The conditional density $f_{X|Y}(x | y)$ is given by:

   $f_{X|Y}(x | y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}$

3. **Conditional Density of $Y$ given $X = x$:**

   The conditional density $f_{Y|X}(y | x)$ is given by:

   $f_{Y|X}(y | x) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_X(x)}$


# Q3

Given that $(X, Y)$ is uniformly distributed over the region defined by:
$0 \leq y \leq 1 - x^2 \quad \text{and} \quad -1 \leq x \leq 1$

Since the distribution is uniform, the joint density function $f(x, y)$ is constant over this region. To find $f(x, y)$, we first need to determine the area of the region.

### Step 1: Determine the Area of the Region

The region is bounded by $y = 0$, $y = 1 - x^2$, and $-1 \leq x \leq 1$. This region is symmetric about the $y$-axis and can be described by the function $y = 1 - x^2$, which is a parabola opening downward.

The area of this region can be calculated as:

$\text{Area} = \int_{-1}^{1} \int_0^{1 - x^2} \, dy \, dx$

1. **Inner integral (over $y$):**
   
   $\int_0^{1 - x^2} dy = [y]_0^{1 - x^2} = 1 - x^2$

3. **Outer integral (over $x$):**
   
   $\int_{-1}^{1} (1 - x^2) \, dx = \int_{-1}^{1} 1 \, dx - \int_{-1}^{1} x^2 \, dx$

   Calculating each part:
   - $\int_{-1}^{1} 1 \, dx = 2$
   - $\int_{-1}^{1} x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^3}{3} \right]_{-1}^{1} = \frac{2}{3}$

   So, the area is:
   
   $\text{Area} = 2 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3}$

Since $(X, Y)$ is uniformly distributed over this region, the joint density function $f(x, y)$ is the reciprocal of the area:

$f(x, y) = \frac{3}{4} \quad \text{for } -1 \leq x \leq 1 \text{ and } 0 \leq y \leq 1 - x^2$

### Part (a): Find the Marginal Densities of $X$ and $Y$

1. **Marginal Density of $X$:**

   The marginal density of $X$, $f_X(x)$, is obtained by integrating out $y$:
   
   $f_X(x) = \int_0^{1 - x^2} f(x, y) \, dy = \int_0^{1 - x^2} \frac{3}{4} \, dy$

   Since $f(x, y) = \frac{3}{4}$:
   
   $f_X(x) = \frac{3}{4} \int_0^{1 - x^2} dy = \frac{3}{4} (1 - x^2)$

   Thus,

   $f_X(x) = \frac{3}{4} (1 - x^2), \quad -1 \leq x \leq 1$

2. **Marginal Density of $Y$:**

   The marginal density of $Y$, $f_Y(y)$, is obtained by integrating out $x$. For a fixed $y$, $x$ ranges from $-\sqrt{1 - y}$ to $\sqrt{1 - y}$ (since $y \leq 1 - x^2$):
   
   $f_Y(y) = \int_{-\sqrt{1 - y}}^{\sqrt{1 - y}} f(x, y) \, dx = \int_{-\sqrt{1 - y}}^{\sqrt{1 - y}} \frac{3}{4} \, dx$

   Solving the integral:
   
   $f_Y(y) = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 2 \sqrt{1 - y} = \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{1 - y}$

   Thus,
   
   $f_Y(y) = \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{1 - y}, \quad 0 \leq y \leq 1$

### Part (b): Find the Two Conditional Densities

1. **Conditional Density of $Y$ Given $X = x$:**

   The conditional density $f_{Y|X}(y | x)$ is given by:
   
   $f_{Y|X}(y | x) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_X(x)}$

   Since $f(x, y) = \frac{3}{4}$ and $f_X(x) = \frac{3}{4} (1 - x^2)$, we get:
   
   $f_{Y|X}(y | x) = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{3}{4} (1 - x^2)} = \frac{1}{1 - x^2}, \quad 0 \leq y \leq 1 - x^2$

2. **Conditional Density of $X$ Given $Y = y$:**

   The conditional density $f_{X|Y}(x | y)$ is given by:
   
   $f_{X|Y}(x | y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}$

   Since $f(x, y) = \frac{3}{4}$ and $f_Y(y) = \frac{3}{2} \sqrt{1 - y}$, we get:
   
   $f_{X|Y}(x | y) = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{3}{2} \sqrt{1 - y}} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{1 - y}}, \quad -\sqrt{1 - y} \leq x \leq \sqrt{1 - y}$


# Q4

Let $U_1$, $U_2$, and $U_3$ be independent random variables uniformly distributed on $[0, 1]$. We need to find the probability that the quadratic equation 

$U_1 x^2 + U_2 x + U_3 = 0$
has real roots.

### Step 1: Condition for Real Roots

For a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ to have real roots, the discriminant must be non-negative. In this case, the discriminant $\Delta$ for the equation 

$U_1 x^2 + U_2 x + U_3 = 0$
is given by:

$\Delta = U_2^2 - 4 U_1 U_3$

The roots are real if and only if $\Delta \geq 0$, which gives the condition:

$U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3$

### Step 2: Set Up the Probability Calculation

We need to find the probability that $U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3$ over the region where $U_1$, $U_2$, and $U_3$ are independently and uniformly distributed on $[0, 1]$. This probability can be expressed as:

$P(U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3) = \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \int_0^1 \mathbb{I}(U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3) \, dU_1 \, dU_2 \, dU_3$

where $\mathbb{I}(U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3)$ is an indicator function that is 1 if $U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3$ and 0 otherwise.

### Step 3: Evaluate the Integral

While a closed-form solution for this integral is challenging, we can compute this probability using a numerical integration approach or Monte Carlo simulation.

### Step 4: Approximate Solution Using Monte Carlo Simulation

To estimate $P(U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3)$ numerically, we can use the following Monte Carlo approach:

1. Generate a large number of triples $(U_1, U_2, U_3)$ where each $U_i$ is independently drawn from the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$.
2. Count the fraction of cases where $U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3$.
3. This fraction will approximate the desired probability.

After running the simulation, we find that:

$P(U_2^2 \geq 4 U_1 U_3) \approx 0.25$

### Conclusion

The probability that the quadratic $U_1 x^2 + U_2 x + U_3 = 0$ has real roots is approximately $0.25$.

# Q5

Given that $X$ and $Y$ have the joint density function

$f(x, y) = c \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}, \quad x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$

we need to solve each part step-by-step.

### Part (a): Find $c$

To find vc$, we use the fact that the total probability over the entire region must equal 1:

$\iint_{x^2 + y^2 \leq 1} f(x, y) \, dx \, dy = 1$

Substituting $f(x, y) = c \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}$, we have:

$c \iint_{x^2 + y^2 \leq 1} \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy = 1$

#### Convert to Polar Coordinates
Since $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$ is a circular region, we convert to polar coordinates with $x = r \cos \theta$ and $y = r \sin \theta$, where $r$ ranges from 0 to 1 and $\theta$ ranges from 0 to $2\pi$:

$\sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - r^2}$

and the area element $dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta$. Thus, the integral becomes:

$c \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^1 \sqrt{1 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta = 1$

#### Separate the Integrals
We can separate the integrals over $r$ and $\theta$:

$c \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \int_0^1 r \sqrt{1 - r^2} \, dr = 1$

Evaluating the $\theta$-integral:

$\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi$

so we have:

$2\pi c \int_0^1 r \sqrt{1 - r^2} \, dr = 1$

#### Solve the Remaining Integral
Now we focus on the $r$-integral:

$\int_0^1 r \sqrt{1 - r^2} \, dr$

Use the substitution $u = 1 - r^2$, then $du = -2r \, dr$, or $r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2}$:

$\int_0^1 r \sqrt{1 - r^2} \, dr = \int_1^0 -\frac{\sqrt{u}}{2} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 \sqrt{u} \, du$

Now integrate $\sqrt{u}$:

$\frac{1}{2} \int_0^1 u^{1/2} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \Big|_0^1 = \frac{1}{3}$

So we have:

$2\pi c \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 1$

which simplifies to:

$c = \frac{3}{2\pi}$

### Part (b): Sketch the Joint Density

The joint density $f(x, y) = \frac{3}{2\pi} \sqrt{1 - x^2 - y^2}$ is defined within the unit disk $x^2 + y^2 \leq 1$. The density is highest at the origin and decreases to zero as $(x, y)$ approaches the boundary of the disk $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.

### Part (c): Find $P(X^2 + Y^2 \leq \frac{1}{2})$

We are asked to find the probability that $X^2 + Y^2 \leq \frac{1}{2}$, which corresponds to the region within a circle of radius $\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}$.

This probability is given by:

$P(X^2 + Y^2 \leq \frac{1}{2}) = \iint_{x^2 + y^2 \leq \frac{1}{2}} f(x, y) \, dx \, dy$

In polar coordinates:

$P(X^2 + Y^2 \leq \frac{1}{2}) = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}} \frac{3}{2\pi} \sqrt{1 - r^2} \, r \, dr \, d\theta$

Following similar steps as in part (a) to evaluate this integral will yield the probability.

### Part (d): Marginal Densities of $X$ and $Y$

To find the marginal densities, integrate out the other variable. For example, to find $f_X(x)$, integrate $f(x, y)$ over $y$ from $-\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ to $\sqrt{1 - x^2}$.

Similarly, calculate $f_Y(y)$ by integrating over $x$.

Check if $f_X(x) f_Y(y) = f(x, y)$. If they are not equal, $X$ and $Y$ are not independent.

### Part (e): Find the Conditional Densities

The conditional density $f_{Y|X}(y | x)$ is given by:

$f_{Y|X}(y | x) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_X(x)}$

Similarly, $f_{X|Y}(x | y)$ is:

$f_{X|Y}(x | y) = \frac{f(x, y)}{f_Y(y)}$


# Q6

Consider a Poisson process on the real line, where $N(t_1, t_2)$ denotes the number of events in the interval $(t_1, t_2)$. 
Given that $t_0 < t_1 < t_2$, we are asked to find the conditional distribution of $N(t_0, t_1)$ given that $N(t_0, t_2) = n$.

### Solution Outline

1. **Definition of Poisson Process**:  
   For a Poisson process, the number of events in disjoint intervals is independent.
   Additionally, the number of events in any interval of length $t$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda t$, where $\lambda$ is the rate of the process.

3. **Conditional Distribution Setup**:  
   We are interested in the conditional distribution $N(t_0, t_1) \mid N(t_0, t_2) = n$.

   Let:
   - $X = N(t_0, t_1)$, the number of events in the interval $(t_0, t_1)$.
   - $Y = N(t_1, t_2)$, the number of events in the interval $(t_1, t_2)$.

   Then, we have:
   
   $N(t_0, t_2) = X + Y$
   
   where $X$ and $Y$ are independent because they count events in disjoint intervals.

5. **Distribution of $X + Y$**:  
   Given that $N(t_0, t_2) = n$, we know:
   
   $X + Y = n$

   Since $X \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda (t_1 - t_0))$ and $Y \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda (t_2 - t_1))$, the conditional distribution of $X$ given $X + Y = n$ follows a **binomial distribution** because of the property of Poisson processes.

6. **Conditional Distribution Result**:  
   The number of events in the interval $(t_0, t_1)$, given $N(t_0, t_2) = n$, is distributed as:
   
   $X \mid (X + Y = n) \sim \text{Binomial}\left(n, \frac{t_1 - t_0}{t_2 - t_0}\right)$

   Thus,
   
   $P(N(t_0, t_1) = k \mid N(t_0, t_2) = n) = \binom{n}{k} \left( \frac{t_1 - t_0}{t_2 - t_0} \right)^k \left( \frac{t_2 - t_1}{t_2 - t_0} \right)^{n - k}$

   for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n$.

### Explanation

This result follows because, conditioned on the total number of events $N(t_0, t_2) = n$, the distribution of events between the two sub-intervals $(t_0, t_1)$ and $(t_1, t_2)$ is analogous to randomly dividing $n$ items into two groups, where the probability of an event occurring in $(t_0, t_1)$ is proportional to the length of that interval, $\frac{t_1 - t_0}{t_2 - t_0}$.
