# Question
## Prove: If A ⊆ B, then P(A) ≤ P(B)

# Answer
### Definitions

- P(A ∩ B): The probability that both events A and B happen together (joint probability).
- P(A|B): The conditional probability of A given B, which is defined as:

  P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

This formula expresses that the probability of A given B is the probability that both A and B occur divided by the probability of B occurring.

### Proof

1. **Start with the definition of conditional probability:**

   P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

2. **Rearrange the formula to solve for P(A ∩ B):**

   Multiply both sides of the equation by P(B):

   P(A ∩ B) = P(A|B) ⋅ P(B)

This is the **Multiplication Law**, which expresses the joint probability P(A ∩ B) in terms of the conditional probability P(A|B) and the probability of B.
