# Question
# Prove: If A∈B, then P(A)≤P(B)
### Definitions

- \( P(A \cap B) \): The probability that both events \( A \) and \( B \) happen together (joint probability).
- \( P(A|B) \): The conditional probability of \( A \) given \( B \), which is defined as:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad \text{(as long as } P(B) \neq 0\text{)}
\]

This formula expresses that the probability of \( A \) given \( B \) is the probability that both \( A \) and \( B \) occur divided by the probability of \( B \) occurring.

### Step-by-Step Proof

1. **Start with the definition of conditional probability:**

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \quad \text{(provided that } P(B) \neq 0\text{)}
\]

2. **Rearrange the formula to solve for \( P(A \cap B) \):**

Multiply both sides of the equation by \( P(B) \):

\[
P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B)
\]

This is the **Multiplication Law**, which expresses the joint probability \( P(A \cap B) \) in terms of the conditional probability \( P(A|B) \) and the probability of \( B \).

---

### Interpretation

The multiplication law shows that the probability of both \( A \) and \( B \) occurring (joint probability) can be broken down into two parts:

1. The probability of \( B \),
2. And then, given that \( B \) has occurred, the probability of \( A \).
