## Question
If a five-letter word is formed at random (meaning that all sequences of five letters
are equally likely), what is the probability that no letter occurs more than once?
## Solution
### Step 1: All Possible Words
26 English letters $\rightarrow$ total 26^5 possible words

### Step 2: Words with no repeated letters

- For the first letter: 26 choices (all letters are available).
- For the second letter: 25 choices (one letter has already been used).
- For the third letter: 24 choices.
- For the fourth letter: 23 choices.
- For the fifth letter: 22 choices.

$\rightarrow$ 26 * 25 * 24 * 23 * 22 possible words that no letter occurs more than once

### Step 3: Final Answer
$$\large{\frac{26 * 25 * 24 * 23 * 22}{26^5} = \frac{25 * 24 * 23 * 22}{26^5}}$$
