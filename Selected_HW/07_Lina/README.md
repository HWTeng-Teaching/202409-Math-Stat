# Problem
## What is the coefficient of $$x^2 y^2 z^3$$ in the Expansion of $$(x + y + z)^7$$?

In the expansion of $$(x + y + z)^7$$, we want to find the coefficient of the term $$x^2 y^2 z^3$$.

# Solution
## Multinomial Expansion Formula

The multinomial expansion of $$(x + y + z)^7$$ is given by:

$$\[
(x + y + z)^7 = \sum \binom{7}{a, b, c} x^a y^b z^c
\]$$

Where $$\(a + b + c = 7)\$$, and the multinomial coefficient $$\(\binom{7}{a, b, c}\)$$ is:

$$\[
\binom{7}{a, b, c} = \frac{7!}{a! b! c!}
\]$$

### For the term $\(x^2 y^2 z^3\)$:

We have $$\(a = 2\), \(b = 2\)$$, and $$\(c = 3\)$$, so the coefficient is:

$$\[
\binom{7}{2, 2, 3} = \frac{7!}{2! 2! 3!} = \frac{5040}{2 \times 2 \times 6} = \frac{5040}{24} = 210
\]$$

Thus, the coefficient of $$\(x^2 y^2 z^3\)$$ is **210**.
