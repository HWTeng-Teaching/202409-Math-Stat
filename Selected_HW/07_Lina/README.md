# Coefficient of x^2 y^2 z^3 in the Expansion of (x + y + z)^7

## Problem Statement

We want to find the coefficient of the term x^2 y^2 z^3 in the expansion of (x + y + z)^7.

## Solution

The multinomial expansion formula for (x + y + z)^7 is:

(x + y + z)^7 = Î£ [ C(7; a, b, c) * x^a * y^b * z^c ]

Where a + b + c = 7, and C(7; a, b, c) is the multinomial coefficient:

C(7; a, b, c) = 7! / (a! * b! * c!)

### For x^2 y^2 z^3:

We have a = 2, b = 2, and c = 3. So the multinomial coefficient is:

C(7; 2, 2, 3) = 7! / (2! * 2! * 3!)  
              = 5040 / (2 * 2 * 6)  
              = 5040 / 24  
              = 210

Thus, the coefficient of x^2 y^2 z^3 is **210**.
