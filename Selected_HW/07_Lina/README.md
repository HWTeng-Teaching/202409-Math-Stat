# Coefficient of \(x^2 y^2 z^3\) in the Expansion of \((x + y + z)^7\)

## Problem Statement

We want to find the coefficient of the term \(x^2 y^2 z^3\) in the expansion of \((x + y + z)^7\).

## Solution

The multinomial expansion formula for \((x + y + z)^7\) is:

\[
(x + y + z)^7 = \sum \binom{7}{a, b, c} x^a y^b z^c
\]

where \(a + b + c = 7\), and \(\binom{7}{a, b, c}\) is the multinomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{7}{a, b, c} = \frac{7!}{a! b! c!}
\]

### For \(x^2 y^2 z^3\):

We have \(a = 2\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = 3\), so the multinomial coefficient is:

\[
\binom{7}{2, 2, 3} = \frac{7!}{2! 2! 3!} = \frac{5040}{2 \times 2 \times 6} = \frac{5040}{24} = 210
\]

Thus, the coefficient of \(x^2 y^2 z^3\) is **210**.
