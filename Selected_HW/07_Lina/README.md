#Problem 
## What is the coefficient of $$\x^2 y^2 z^3\$$ in the Expansion of $$\(x + y + z)^7$$?

# Solution

1. **Total Power**:  
   The expansion of $$\(x + y + z)^7$$ requires that the sum of the exponents in each term must equal 7. That is:  
   $$\[
   a + b + c = 7
   \]$$  
   where $$\a$$ is the exponent of $$\x$$, $$\b$$ is the exponent of $$\y$$, and $$\c$$ is the exponent of $$\z$$.

2. **For the term $$\x^2 y^2 z^3$$:  
   The exponents for $$\x\$$, $$\y\$$, and $$\z\$$ are $$\a = 2\$$, $$\b = 2\$$, and $$\c = 3\$$, respectively. So, we want to find the coefficient of this specific term.

3. **Coefficient Using Combinations**:  
   The coefficient is found using the multinomial formula:  
   $$\[
   \frac{7!}{2!2!3!}
   \]$$

4. **Calculation**:  
   First, calculate the factorials:  
   $$\[
   7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
   \]$$  
   $$\[
   2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
   \]$$  
   $$\[
   3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
   \]$$  
   Now substitute into the formula:  
   $$\[
   \frac{7!}{2!2!3!} = \frac{5040}{2 \times 2 \times 6} = \frac{5040}{24} = 210
   \]$$

Thus, the coefficient of $$\x^2 y^2 z^3$$ is **210**.
