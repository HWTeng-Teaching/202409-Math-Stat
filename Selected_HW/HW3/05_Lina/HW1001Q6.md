### 1. Probability Density Function (PDF)
For a continuous random variable $X$ uniformly distributed over $[-1, 1]$, the PDF is constant over this interval, because each point in the interval has an equal probability of being chosen. The total probability is 1, and the length of the interval is 2. Hence, the PDF is given by:

$$
f_X(x) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{2}, & -1 \leq x \leq 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### 2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
The CDF $F_X(x)$ is the integral of the PDF up to $x$. This gives the probability that the random variable $X$ takes a value less than or equal to $x$. The CDF is defined as:

$$
F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f_X(t) \, dt
$$

Thus, the CDF for a Uniform distribution on $[-1, 1]$ is:

$$
F_X(x) = \begin{cases} 
0, & x < -1 \\
\frac{x + 1}{2}, & -1 \leq x \leq 1 \\
1, & x > 1
\end{cases}
$$
