### Probability Mass Function of a Bernoulli Random Variable

- **\( P(X = 1) = p \)**: This means that the probability of success (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 1) is \( p \).

- **\( P(X = 0) = 1 - p \)**: This indicates that the probability of failure (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 0) is \( 1 - p \), which is the complement of the probability of success.

- **\( P(X = x) = 0 \)** for any other values of \( x \): This part states that the random variable \( X \) cannot take any values other than 0 or 1; thus, the probability for any other outcome is zero.
