## Problem

Consider a Bernoulli trial, which is a random experiment with only two possible outcomes: success (with probability \( p \)) and failure (with probability \( 1 - p \)). Based on the Bernoulli trial, let \( X \) be a Bernoulli random variable, where:

- \( X(\text{success}) = 1 \), i.e., \( X \) maps success to 1.
- \( X(\text{failure}) = 0 \), i.e., \( X \) maps failure to 0.

In other words, \( X = 1 \) represents a success, and \( X = 0 \) represents a failure.

Define the probability mass function (pmf) of \( X \), i.e., write \( P(X = x) \) for all possible values of \( x \).

## Answer
### Probability Mass Function of a Bernoulli Random Variable

- **\( P(X = 1) = p \)**: This means that the probability of success (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 1) is \( p \).

- **\( P(X = 0) = 1 - p \)**: This indicates that the probability of failure (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 0) is \( 1 - p \), which is the complement of the probability of success.

- **\( P(X = x) = 0 \)** for any other values of \( x \): This part states that the random variable \( X \) cannot take any values other than 0 or 1; thus, the probability for any other outcome is zero.
