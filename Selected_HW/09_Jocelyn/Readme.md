### Question

33. An elevator containing five people can stop at any of seven floors. What is the probability that no two people get off at the same floor? Assume that the occupants act independently and that all floors are equally likely for each occupant.

### Answer

Step 1: Calculate the possible outcome
There are 5 people, and each can choose 1 floor out of 7. Hence, the possible outcome is
\[ 
7^5 
\] = 16807
