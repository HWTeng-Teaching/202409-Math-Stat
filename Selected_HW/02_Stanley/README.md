# Problem:
###### 1-15
How many different meals can be made from four kinds of meat, six vegetables,
and three starches if a meal consists of one selection from each group?

# Solution:
To determine how many different meals can be made, we need to multiply the number of options in each category.  
There are:  
4 kinds of meat,  
6 kinds of vegetables, and  
3 kinds of starches.  
The total number of different meals is:  
$$\binom{4}{1} $$× $$\binom{6}{1} $$× $$\binom{3}{1} $$  
4×6×3=72  
Thus, 72 different meals can be made.
