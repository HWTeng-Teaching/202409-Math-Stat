# Proposition C

Let Z = F(X); then Z has a uniform distribution on [0, 1].

## Proof

1. **Find the CDF of Z**: To find the distribution of Z, we can assume the cdf of random varible Z is f(z), 
   <br>
   f(z) = P(Z ≤ z) for z ∈ [0, 1]:
   
   P(Z ≤ z) = P(F(X) ≤ z)

2. **Use the Properties of the CDF**: Since F is a strictly increasing function(the definaition of cdf),<br> the event F(X) ≤ z is equivalent to X ≤ F<sup>-1</sup>(z):
   <br>
   P(F(X) ≤ z) = P(X ≤ F<sup>-1</sup>(z))

3. **Apply the Definition of the CDF**: By the definition of the CDF:
   <br>
   P(X ≤ F<sup>-1</sup>(z)) = F(F<sup>-1</sup>(z))
   
   F(F<sup>-1</sup>(z)) evaluates the CDF at the point where the cumulative probability is z.

5. **Simplify**: For a continuous random variable, F(F<sup>-1</sup>(z)) = z for z ∈ [0, 1]:
   <br>
   P(Z ≤ z) = z

6. **Conclusion**: Since P(Z ≤ z) = z, this shows that Z follows a uniform distribution on [0, 1].
