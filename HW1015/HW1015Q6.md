#### Joint Distribution of Games Won by Three Players

Three players play 10 independent rounds of a game, where each player has a probability of $\( \frac{1}{3} \)$ of winning each round. We want to find the joint distribution of the numbers of games won by each of the three players.

#### Problem Setup

Let:
- \( X_1 \): the number of games won by Player 1,
- \( X_2 \): the number of games won by Player 2,
- \( X_3 \): the number of games won by Player 3.

We are interested in the joint distribution of \( (X_1, X_2, X_3) \).

#### Distribution

Since there are three players and the total number of games is 10, the number of wins for each player follows a multinomial distribution. The parameters for this distribution are:
- Total number of trials (games), \( n = 10 \),
- The probabilities of winning for each player: 
  - $\( p_1 = \frac{1}{3} \)$,
  - $\( p_2 = \frac{1}{3} \)$,
  - $\( p_3 = \frac{1}{3} \)$.

The joint distribution of $\( (X_1, X_2, X_3) \)$ is given by:

$$
P(X_1 = k_1, X_2 = k_2, X_3 = k_3) = \frac{10!}{k_1! k_2! k_3!} p_1^{k_1} p_2^{k_2} p_3^{k_3}
$$

where:
- $\( k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 10 \)$ (the total number of games played),
- $\( k_1, k_2, k_3 \geq 0 \)$ (the number of games won by each player).

Substituting the values for \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \):

$$
P(X_1 = k_1, X_2 = k_2, X_3 = k_3) = \frac{10!}{k_1! k_2! k_3!} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{k_1} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{k_2} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{k_3}
$$

This can be simplified to:

$$
P(X_1 = k_1, X_2 = k_2, X_3 = k_3) = \frac{10!}{k_1! k_2! k_3!} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{10}
$$

#### Summary

Thus, the joint distribution of the number of games won by each of the three players is given by:

$$
P(X_1 = k_1, X_2 = k_2, X_3 = k_3) = \frac{10!}{k_1! k_2! k_3!} \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{10}, \quad \text{for } k_1 + k_2 + k_3 = 10 \text{ and } k_1, k_2, k_3 \geq 0.
$$

This represents a multinomial distribution with parameters $\( n = 10 \)$ and $\( p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \frac{1}{3} \)$.
