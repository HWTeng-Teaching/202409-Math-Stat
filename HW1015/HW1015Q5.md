## Answers

a.  
We need to find some coprime numbers to ensure that the generated numbers won't fall into a loop.  
so we choose a = 5, c = 3, m = 16, and seed number $x_0 = 7$.  
and the generated numbers are 7, 6, 1, 8, 11, 10, 5, 12, 15, 14, 9, 0, 3, 2, 13, 4, 7...  
looks 'random'  
b.  
RANDU  
```
def linear_congruential_generator(a, c, m, x0, n):
    sequence = [x0]
    for _ in range(n):
        x_next = (a * sequence[-1] + c) % m
        sequence.append(x_next)
    return sequence

a = 69069
c = 0
m = 2 ** 31
x0 = 1
n = 10

sequence = linear_congruential_generator(a, c, m, x0, n)

for i, x in enumerate(sequence):
    print(f"x{i} = {x}")
```

It looks 'random'  
But there are only odd numbers.  
If the seed is an even number, and there will be all even numbers.  

The normalized chart :  
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def linear_congruential_generator(a, c, m, x0, n):
    sequence = [x0]
    for _ in range(n):
        x_next = (a * sequence[-1] + c) % m
        sequence.append(x_next)
    return sequence

a = 69069
c = 0
m = 2 ** 31
x0 = 1
n = 10000

sequence = linear_congruential_generator(a, c, m, x0, n)

sequence_normalized = [x / m for x in sequence]

plt.plot(sequence_normalized)
plt.xlabel('n')
plt.ylabel('x(normalize)')
plt.title('Linear Congruential Generator Sequence (Normalized)')
plt.show()
```
