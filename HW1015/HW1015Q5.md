## Answers

a.  
We need to find some coprime numbers to ensure that the generated numbers won't fall into a loop.  
so we choose a = 5, c = 3, m = 16, and seed number $x_0 = 7$.  
and the generated numbers are 7, 6, 1, 8, 11, 10, 5, 12, 15, 14, 9, 0, 3, 2, 13, 4, 7...  
looks 'random'

It looks 'random'  
But there are only odd numbers.  
If the seed is an even number, and there will be all even numbers.
