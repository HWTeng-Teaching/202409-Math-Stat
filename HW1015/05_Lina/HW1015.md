## Q3
**Find the density function of $Y = e^Z$, where $Z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. This is called the lognormal density, since $\log Y$ is normally distributed.**

#### Solution:
Given that $Z \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, we need to find the probability density function (PDF) of $Y = e^Z$.

1. **Step 1: Write the PDF of $Z$:**
   The PDF of $Z$ is given by:
   
   $$f_Z(z) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(z - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$
   
   for $z \in (-\infty, \infty)$.

3. **Step 2: Change of variable to $Y$:**
   Let $Y = e^Z$, so that $Z = \log Y$. The derivative of this transformation is $\frac{dZ}{dY} = \frac{1}{Y}$. Thus, the PDF of $Y$ can be found using the change of variable formula:

   $$f_Y(y) = f_Z(\log y) \cdot \left| \frac{dZ}{dY} \right|$$

   Substituting the values, we get:
   
   $$f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{y\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\log y - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

   for $y > 0$.

Thus, the PDF of the lognormal random variable $Y$ is:

$$f_Y(y) = \frac{1}{y\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{(\log y - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right), \quad y > 0$$

## Q4
**Find the density of $cX$ when $X$ follows a gamma distribution. Show that only $\lambda$ is affected by such a transformation, which justifies calling $\lambda$ a scale parameter.**

#### Solution:
Suppose $X \sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha, \lambda)$, where the PDF of $X$ is:

$$f_X(x) = \frac{\lambda^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{\alpha-1} e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x > 0$$

We want to find the PDF of $Y = cX$, where $c > 0$.

1. **Step 1: Change of variable:**
   Let $Y = cX$. Then $X = \frac{Y}{c}$, and the derivative of this transformation is $\frac{dX}{dY} = \frac{1}{c}$.

2. **Step 2: Use the change of variable formula:**
   The PDF of $Y$ can be written as:
   
   $$f_Y(y) = f_X\left(\frac{y}{c}\right) \cdot \left| \frac{dX}{dY} \right|$$
   
   Substituting the values:

   $$f_Y(y) = \frac{\lambda^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} \left(\frac{y}{c}\right)^{\alpha-1} \exp\left(-\lambda \frac{y}{c}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{c}$$

4. **Step 3: Simplify the expression:**
   Simplifying the expression, we get:

   $$f_Y(y) = \frac{(\lambda/c)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} y^{\alpha-1} \exp\left(-\frac{\lambda}{c} y\right), \quad y > 0$$

This shows that the new PDF is a gamma distribution with the same shape parameter $\alpha$, but with a new rate parameter $\lambda' = \frac{\lambda}{c}$. This transformation only affects $\lambda$, which justifies calling $\lambda$ the scale parameter.

Thus, the PDF of $Y = cX$ is:

$$f_Y(y) = \frac{(\lambda/c)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} y^{\alpha-1} \exp\left(-\frac{\lambda}{c} y\right), \quad y > 0$$

## Q5
One of the most commonly used (but not one of the best) methods of generating pseudorandom numbers is the linear congruential method, which works as follows. Let $x_0$ be an initial number (the "seed"). The sequence is generated recursively as

$$x_n = (a \cdot x_{n-1} + c) \, \text{mod} \, m$$

#### a. Choose values of $a$, $c$, and $m$, and try this out. Do the sequences "look" random?

#### b. Making good choices of $a$, $c$, and $m$ involves both art and theory. The following are some values that have been proposed: 
- (1) $a = 69069$, $c = 0$, $m = 2^{31}$ 
- (2) $a = 65539$, $c = 0$, $m = 2^{31}$ (This is the infamous generator called RANDU). Try out these schemes and examine the results.

## Q6
Three players play 10 independent rounds of a game, and each player has a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ of winning each round. Find the joint distribution of the numbers of games won by each of the three players.

---

### Solution:

This is a problem involving the **multinomial distribution**, because:
- There are three players.
- Each player has a probability $p = \frac{1}{3}$ of winning any given round.
- There are 10 independent rounds.
- In each round, only one player can win.

#### Definition of Multinomial Distribution:
The multinomial distribution is a generalization of the binomial distribution. It describes the outcomes of $n$ independent trials where each trial results in exactly one of $k$ possible outcomes. The joint probability mass function for the multinomial distribution is:

$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, \dots, X_k = x_k) = \frac{n!}{x_1! x_2! \dots x_k!} p_1^{x_1} p_2^{x_2} \dots p_k^{x_k}$$

where:
- $X_i$ is the number of times outcome $i$ occurs,
- $n = \sum_{i=1}^k x_i$ is the total number of trials,
- $p_i$ is the probability of outcome $i$,
- $k$ is the number of possible outcomes.

#### Applying to This Problem:
- $n = 10$ (since there are 10 rounds).
- There are 3 players, so $k = 3$.
- The probability for each player to win a round is $p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \frac{1}{3}$.

Let $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$ denote the number of games won by Player 1, Player 2, and Player 3, respectively. These follow a multinomial distribution with parameters $n = 10$ and probabilities $p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \frac{1}{3}$.

The joint distribution of the number of games won by each player is:

$$P(X_1 = x_1, X_2 = x_2, X_3 = x_3) = \frac{10!}{x_1! x_2! x_3!} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{x_1} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{x_2} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{x_3}$$

subject to the constraint $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 10$.

#### Example:
If we want to find the probability that Player 1 wins 4 games, Player 2 wins 3 games, and Player 3 wins 3 games, we substitute into the formula:

$$P(X_1 = 4, X_2 = 3, X_3 = 3) = \frac{10!}{4! 3! 3!} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^4 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3 \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^3$$

This evaluates to:

$$P(X_1 = 4, X_2 = 3, X_3 = 3) = \frac{10!}{4!3!3!} \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{10} = \frac{3628800}{24 \times 6 \times 6} \times \frac{1}{59049}$$

Simplifying:

$$P(X_1 = 4, X_2 = 3, X_3 = 3) = \frac{3628800}{864} \times \frac{1}{59049} = 4200 \times \frac{1}{59049} = \frac{1400}{19683} \approx 0.0711$$

Thus, the probability that Player 1 wins 4 games, Player 2 wins 3 games, and Player 3 wins 3 games is approximately 0.0711.

---

### Conclusion:

The joint distribution of the number of games won by each player in 10 independent rounds is multinomial with parameters $n = 10$ and $p_1 = p_2 = p_3 = \frac{1}{3}$. The probability of any specific combination of wins for the players can be calculated using the multinomial formula.

## Q7
A point is chosen randomly in the interior of an ellipse:

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

Find the marginal densities of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point.

---

### Solution:

To find the marginal densities of $x$ and $y$ for a point chosen randomly in the interior of the ellipse, we assume a **uniform distribution** over the area of the ellipse. The probability density function (PDF) is constant over the area of the ellipse.

#### Area of the Ellipse:
The area $A$ of an ellipse with semi-major axis $a$ and semi-minor axis $b$ is given by:

$$A = \pi a b$$

Thus, the uniform probability density function is:

$$f(x, y) = \frac{1}{\pi a b}, \quad \text{for points inside the ellipse.}$$

#### Marginal Density for $x$:
To find the marginal density of $x$, we integrate out $y$ from the joint density. From the equation of the ellipse, $y$ can be written in terms of $x$ as:

$$y = \pm b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}$$

Thus, the marginal density of $x$ is:

$$f_X(x) = \int_{-b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}}^{b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}} \frac{1}{\pi a b} \, dy$$

This simplifies to:

$$f_X(x) = \frac{2b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}}{\pi a b} = \frac{2}{\pi a} \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}, \quad -a \leq x \leq a$$

#### Marginal Density for $y$:
Similarly, to find the marginal density of $y$, we integrate out $x$:

$$f_Y(y) = \int_{-a \sqrt{1 - \frac{y^2}{b^2}}}^{a \sqrt{1 - \frac{y^2}{b^2}}} \frac{1}{\pi a b} \, dx$$

This simplifies to:

$$f_Y(y) = \frac{2a \sqrt{1 - \frac{y^2}{b^2}}}{\pi a b} = \frac{2}{\pi b} \sqrt{1 - \frac{y^2}{b^2}}, \quad -b \leq y \leq b$$

Thus, the marginal densities of $x$ and $y$ are:

$$f_X(x) = \frac{2}{\pi a} \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}}, \quad -a \leq x \leq a$$

$$f_Y(y) = \frac{2}{\pi b} \sqrt{1 - \frac{y^2}{b^2}}, \quad -b \leq y \leq b$$

## Q8
Find the joint and marginal densities corresponding to the cdf

$$F(x, y) = (1 - e^{-\alpha x})(1 - e^{-\beta y}), \quad x \geq 0, \, y \geq 0, \, \alpha > 0, \, \beta > 0$$

---

### Solution:

The given function is the cumulative distribution function (CDF). To find the **joint probability density function (PDF)**, we differentiate the CDF with respect to both $x$ and $y$:

#### Joint PDF:

$$f_{X,Y}(x, y) = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x \partial y} F(x, y)$$

First, differentiate with respect to $x$:

$$\frac{\partial}{\partial x} F(x, y) = \alpha e^{-\alpha x} (1 - e^{-\beta y})$$

Next, differentiate this with respect to $y$:

$$f_{X,Y}(x, y) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \alpha e^{-\alpha x} (1 - e^{-\beta y}) \right) = \alpha \beta e^{-\alpha x} e^{-\beta y}, \quad x \geq 0, \, y \geq 0$$

Thus, the **joint PDF** is:

$$f_{X,Y}(x, y) = \alpha \beta e^{-\alpha x} e^{-\beta y}, \quad x \geq 0, \, y \geq 0$$

#### Marginal PDFs:

To find the marginal PDF of $X$, integrate the joint PDF over $y$:

$$f_X(x) = \int_0^\infty \alpha \beta e^{-\alpha x} e^{-\beta y} \, dy = \alpha e^{-\alpha x}, \quad x \geq 0$$

Similarly, to find the marginal PDF of $Y$, integrate the joint PDF over $x$:

$$f_Y(y) = \int_0^\infty \alpha \beta e^{-\alpha x} e^{-\beta y} \, dx = \beta e^{-\beta y}, \quad y \geq 0$$

Thus, the **marginal PDFs** are:

$$f_X(x) = \alpha e^{-\alpha x}, \quad x \geq 0$$

$$f_Y(y) = \beta e^{-\beta y}, \quad y \geq 0$$
