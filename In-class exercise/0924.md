Random variable. 

Assume you throw a fair coin three times. Let the random variable, X, denote the number of tails observed. 

1) Please write down the sample space and its associated probabilties. 

Ans : 
Let H and T represent rolling heads and tails respectively.
Sample space S = {(H,H,H),(H,H,T),(H,T,H),(H,T,T),(T,H,H),(T,H,T),(T,T,H),(T,T,T)}
and each element is the side of coin rolled in chronological order.
Each element in S has a probability of 1/8.

2) Please define X, i.e., please write down the possible values of X and the asscociated probabilities. 

Ans:
P(X=0) = 1/8, P(X=1) = 3/8, P(X=2) = 3/8, P(X=3) = 1/8
