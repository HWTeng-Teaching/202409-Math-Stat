## Random variable. 

### Assume you throw a fair coin three times. Let the random variable, X, denote the number of tails observed. 

#### 1. Please write down the sample space and its associated probabilties. 

$\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Ans:}}$ 

Let H and T represent rolling heads and tails respectively.

Define S as Sample space.

S = {(H,H,H),(H,H,T),(H,T,H),(H,T,T),(T,H,H),(T,H,T),(T,T,H),(T,T,T)}

Each element is the side of coin rolled in chronological order and has a probability of 1/8.

#### 2. Please define X, i.e., please write down the possible values of X and the asscociated probabilities. 

$\textbf{\textcolor{red}{Ans:}}$ 

P(X=0) = 1/8, P(X=1) = 3/8, P(X=2) = 3/8, P(X=3) = 1/8
