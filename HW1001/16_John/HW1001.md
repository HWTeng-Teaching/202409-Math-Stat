## Question 1 
![460295185_1134059854813301_8592571888257864543_n (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/545da2b5-10c9-4763-a331-9ac6bfaa569b)
## Answer 
Geometric distribution, X~Geo(p)  
p(k)=P(X=k)= p\* $$(1 - p)^{k-1}$$ p is the success proability; $$(1 - p)^{k-1}$$ is the first k-1 time with fail  
Thus, CDF P(X≦k) = all possible - no success => P(X≦k)=1- $$(1 - p)^{k}$$  
## Question 2

## Answer 
### a.
P(two or more head |　at least one head) = $$\frac{P(\text{ two or more head} \cap \text{at least one head } )}{ P(\text{at least one head} )}$$  
=> $$\frac{\frac{4}{8}}{1-\frac{1}{8}}$$ = $$\frac{4}{7}$$ P(at least one head)=1-P(no head)
### b.
P(at least one tail)=1-P(no tail)=1- $$\frac{1}{8}$$= $$\frac{7}{8}$$

## Answer
for each student's proability of leave is $$\frac{1}{3}$$ and the proability of stay is $$\frac{2}{3}$$
base on the question, now teacher named Jason to stay  
it means that P(Drew leave | Jason stay)+P(Drew stay | Jason stay) should be 1  
=> $$\frac{P(\text{Drew leave} \cap \text{Jason stay} )}{ P(\text{Jason stay} )}$$ = $$\frac{\frac{1}{3} \* \frac{2}{3}}{\frac{2}{3}}$$ and $$\frac{P(\text{Drew stay} \cap \text{Jason stay} )}{ P(\text{Jason stay} )}$$ = $$\frac{\frac{2}{3} \* \frac{2}{3}}{\frac{2}{3}}$$  
=> $$\frac{1}{3}$$ + $$\frac{2}{3}$$ =1
Therefore, the proability of Drew leave while no matter Jason or Chris stay is still $$\frac{1}{3}$$
## Question 4

## Answer
P(work)=1-P(not work)  
for top and buttom path P(work)= $$(1-p)^2$$ => P(not work) = 1- $$(1-p)^2$$
medium path  P(not work) = p  
full system P(not work) = $$(1-(1-p)^2)^2\*p$$ => P(work) = 1- $$(1-(1-p)^2)^2\*p$$
## Question 5

## Answer
P(hit the bull's eye)=0.05 P(not hit the bull's eye)=1-0.05 P(not hit the bull's eye for n trials)= $$(1-0.05)^n$$  
for the P(hit the bull's eye in n trials) should more than 0.5, which means P(not hit the bull's eye for n trials) should be less than 0.5  
P(not hit the bull's eye for n trials)≦0.5 => $$0.95^n$$≦0.5 => n(log0.95)≦log0.5  
$$\frac{log0.5}{log0.95}$$≦n =>　13.51≦n => n at least 14 days
## Question 6
### Consider a Bernoulli trial, which is a random experiment with only two possible outcomes: success (with probability \( p \)) and failure (with probability \( 1 - p \)). Based on the Bernoulli trial, let \( X \) be a Bernoulli random variable, where:
### - \( X(success) = 1 \), i.e., \( X \) maps success to 1.
### - \( X(failure) = 0 \), i.e., \( X \) maps failure to 0.
### In other words, \( X = 1 \) represents a success, and \( X = 0 \) represents a failure.
### Define the probability mass function (pmf) of \( X \), i.e., write \( P(X = x) \) for all possible values of \( x \).
## Answer(Probability Mass Function of a Bernoulli Random Variable)
- **\( P(X = 1) = p \)**: This means that the probability of success (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 1) is \( p \).

- **\( P(X = 0) = 1 - p \)**: This indicates that the probability of failure (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 0) is \( 1 - p \), which is the complement of the probability of success.

- **\( P(X = x) = 0 \)** for any other values of \( x \): This part states that the random variable \( X \) cannot take any values other than 0 or 1; thus, the probability for any other outcome is zero.
