## Question 1 
![460295185_1134059854813301_8592571888257864543_n (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/545da2b5-10c9-4763-a331-9ac6bfaa569b)
## Answer 
Geometric distribution, X~Geo(p)  
p(k)=P(X=k)= p\* $$(1 - p)^{k-1}$$ p is the success proability; $$(1 - p)^{k-1}$$ is the first k-1 time with fail  
Thus, CDF P(X≦k) = all possible - no success => P(X≦k)=1- $$(1 - p)^{k}$$  
## Question 2
![461491947_1917525905396756_1399431880384264752_n](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48b57a01-72ee-4bf6-9e0f-596cac385f68)
## Answer 
P(X>n+k-1 | X>n-1) = $$\frac{P(X > n+k-1 \cap X > n-1)}{P(X > n-1)}$$  
∵ k>0 ∴ P $$(X > n+k-1 \cap X > n-1)$$=P(X > n+k-1)
=> $$\frac{P(X > n+k-1)}{P(X > n-1)}$$  
CDF of P(X≦k)=1- $$(1 - p)^{k}$$, we can get that P(X>k)= $$(1 - p)^{k}$$   
Change $$\frac{P(X > n+k-1)}{P(X > n-1)}$$ into CDF we can get $$\frac{(1 - p)^{n+k-1}}{(1 - p)^{n-1}}$$ = $$(1 - p)^{k}$$  
which equal to P(X>k)   
the probability of success in future trials is independent of failures that have already occurred this is called memoryless property so that the result is obvious
## Question 3

## Answer
### a. 
λ=0.33 per month => λ=0.33*12=3.96 per year  
X~Poisson  
P(X=k)= $$\frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}$$  
P(X = 0) $\approx 0.01906$    
P(X = 1) $\approx 0.07549$    
P(X = 2) $\approx 0.1495$    
P(X = 3) $\approx 0.1973$    
P(X = 4) $\approx 0.1953$    
P(X = 5) $\approx 0.1547$    
base on the λ per year, we can know that the most probable number is 4   
### b.
λ=0.33 per month => λ=0.33*0.25=0.0825 per week  
P(X=2) $\approx 0.0031$

## Answer
To show a function is CDF, it should satisfy  
1.non-decreasing  
F'(x)=f(x)= $$f(x) = \alpha \beta x^{\beta - 1} \exp(-\alpha x^\beta)$$  
2.continuous  
this function is composed of exponential function which is a continuous function  
3.limit  
∵ x<0 F(x)=0 ∴ $$\lim_{x \to -\infty} F(x) = 0$$  
$$\lim_{x \to \infty} F(x) = 1-\lim_{x \to \infty} \exp(-\alpha x^\beta)$$ =1  
Thus, we can know that F is a CDF.  
Then differentiate F(x) to find PDF   
The corresponding probability density function is:  
$$f(x) = \alpha \beta x^{\beta - 1} \exp(-\alpha x^\beta)$$    
## Question 5

## Answer
P(hit the bull's eye)=0.05 P(not hit the bull's eye)=1-0.05 P(not hit the bull's eye for n trials)= $$(1-0.05)^n$$  
for the P(hit the bull's eye in n trials) should more than 0.5, which means P(not hit the bull's eye for n trials) should be less than 0.5  
P(not hit the bull's eye for n trials)≦0.5 => $$0.95^n$$≦0.5 => n(log0.95)≦log0.5  
$$\frac{log0.5}{log0.95}$$≦n =>　13.51≦n => n at least 14 days
## Question 6
### Consider a Bernoulli trial, which is a random experiment with only two possible outcomes: success (with probability \( p \)) and failure (with probability \( 1 - p \)). Based on the Bernoulli trial, let \( X \) be a Bernoulli random variable, where:
### - \( X(success) = 1 \), i.e., \( X \) maps success to 1.
### - \( X(failure) = 0 \), i.e., \( X \) maps failure to 0.
### In other words, \( X = 1 \) represents a success, and \( X = 0 \) represents a failure.
### Define the probability mass function (pmf) of \( X \), i.e., write \( P(X = x) \) for all possible values of \( x \).
## Answer(Probability Mass Function of a Bernoulli Random Variable)
- **\( P(X = 1) = p \)**: This means that the probability of success (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 1) is \( p \).

- **\( P(X = 0) = 1 - p \)**: This indicates that the probability of failure (i.e., the event that \( X \) equals 0) is \( 1 - p \), which is the complement of the probability of success.

- **\( P(X = x) = 0 \)** for any other values of \( x \): This part states that the random variable \( X \) cannot take any values other than 0 or 1; thus, the probability for any other outcome is zero.
