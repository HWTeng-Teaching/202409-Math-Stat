## Questions 

If X is a geometric random variable, show that  
P(X > n + k − 1|X > n − 1) = P(X > k)  
In light of the construction of a geometric distribution from a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, how can this be interpreted so that it is “obvious”?

## Answers

*The survival function* of geometric random variable is P(X > n) = $(1 - p)^n$  
P(X > n + k − 1 | X > n − 1) = $\frac{P(X > n + k − 1 ∩ X > n − 1)}{P(X > n − 1)}$  

Since X > n + k − 1 implies X > n − 1, we have :  
P(X > n + k − 1 ∩ X > n − 1) = P(X > n + k − 1)  
so that, P(X > n + k − 1 | X > n − 1) = $\frac{P(X > n + k − 1)}{P(X > n − 1)}$

Turn to the survival function:  
​P(X > n + k − 1 | X > n − 1) = $\frac{(1 - p)^{n+k-1}}{(1 - p)^{n-1}}$ = $(1 - p)^k$  

This is precisely the probability that X > k:  
P(X > n + k − 1 ∣ X > n − 1) = P(X > k)

The geometric distribution can be interpreted as the number of independent Bernoulli trials until the first success. In this context:  
P(X > n − 1) means the probability that the first success hasn't occurred by trial n − 1, i.e., the first n − 1 trials were all failures.
Given that we know the first n − 1 trials were failures, the distribution "resets," and the process essentially starts fresh from trial n.

Thus, the probability P(X > n + k − 1 ∣ X > n − 1) is the probability that we observe another k consecutive failures starting from trial n, which is the same as the probability of having k consecutive failures starting from the first trial. This explains why:  
P(X > n + k − 1 ∣ X > n − 1) = P(X > k)

This result is "obvious" because the geometric distribution exhibits the memoryless property, meaning the probability of success in future trials is independent of the number of failures that have already occurred.
