## Question 1
Find an expression for the cumulative distribution function of a geometric random
variable.

## Solution 

To find the CDF, note that   
For x<1, $F_X(x) = p $  
For 1≤x<2, $F_X(x) = P_X(1) = p  $   
For 2≤x<3, $F_X(x) = P_X(1)+P_X(2) = p + (1-p)p    $   

In general we have  
For 0<k≤x<k+1,  
$F_X(x)=P_X(1)+P_X(2)+...+P+X(k) =p+(1-p)p+...+(1-p)^(k-1)p$= $\sum_{i=1}^{k}$ p(1-p)^(k-1) = $1 - (1-p)^k$
