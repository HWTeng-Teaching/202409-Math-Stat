# Problem:  
##### 2-30  
### Suppose that in a city, the number of suicides can be approximated by a Poisson process with λ = .33 per month.  
### a. Find the probability of k suicides in a year for k = 0, 1, 2,... . What is the most probable number of suicides?
### b. What is the probability of two suicides in one week?

# Solution:  
a.  
λyear=12×0.33=3.96 suicides per year.  
P(X=k) = $\frac{ e^{-λ}λ^k }{k!}$  
P(X=0)=0.0191  
P(X=1)=0.0755
P(X=2)=0.1495
P(X=3)=0.1973
P(X=4)=0.1953
P(X=5)=0.1547
P(X=6)=0.1021
P(X=7)=0.0578
P(X=8)=0.0286
P(X=9)=0.0126
P(X=10)=0.0050
P(X=11)=0.0018
P(X=12)=0.0006  
​X = 3 is the most probable  
b.  
λweek= $\frac{0.33 }{4.33}$ ≈0.0762  
P(X=2)= $\frac{0.0762^2e^{-0.0762} }{2}$ ≈0.00269  
Thus, the probability of two suicides in one week is approximately  0.27%.
