## Question 19
Find an expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a geometric random variable.

## Solution

Let $X$ be a geometric random variable with parameter $p$, representing the probability of success in each trial.

For $x < 1$,
\[
F_X(x) = 0
\]

For $1 \leq x < 2$,
$\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) = p
\]$

For $2 \leq x < 3$,
$\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = p + (1 - p)p = p(1 + (1 - p))
\]$

In general, for $k \leq x < k + 1$:
$\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + \dots + P(X = k)
\]$
This becomes:
$\[
F_X(x) = p + (1 - p)p + \dots + (1 - p)^{k - 1} p = \sum_{i=1}^{k} p(1 - p)^{i - 1}
\]$

The sum of this geometric series simplifies to:
$\[
F_X(x) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
\]$
Thus, the CDF of a geometric random variable is:
$\[
F_X(x) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
\]$


## Question 21
If $X$ is a geometric random variable, show that:
$\[
P(X > n + k - 1 \mid X > n - 1) = P(X > k)
\]$

## Solution

This equation demonstrates the **memoryless property** of the geometric distribution. We can start by rewriting the left-hand side as:
$\[
P(X > n + k - 1 \mid X > n - 1) = \frac{P(X > n + k - 1 \cap X > n - 1)}{P(X > n - 1)} = \frac{P(X > n + k - 1)}{P(X > n - 1)}
\]$

Since for a geometric random variable:
$\[
P(X > n) = (1 - p)^n
\]$
Substitute this into the expression:
$\[
P(X > n + k - 1 \mid X > n - 1) = \frac{(1 - p)^{n + k - 1}}{(1 - p)^{n - 1}} = (1 - p)^k = P(X > k)
\]$
Thus, the memoryless property is proven.


## Question 30
Suppose that in a city, the number of suicides can be approximated by a Poisson process with $\lambda = 0.33$ per month.

### (a) Find the probability of $k$ suicides in a year for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$. What is the most probable number of suicides?

## Solution

The rate of suicides per year is:
$\[
\lambda_{\text{year}} = 12 \times 0.33 = 3.96
\]$

The probability mass function for a Poisson random variable with rate $\lambda_{\text{year}}$ is:
$P(X = k) = \frac{e^{−λ}λ^k}{k!}$  
$\[
P(X = k) = \frac{(3.96)^k e^{-3.96}}{k!}
\]$
for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$.
 
$P(X = 0) \approx 0.01906$  
$P(X = 1) \approx 0.07549$  
$P(X = 2) \approx 0.1495$  
$P(X = 3) \approx 0.1973$  
$P(X = 4) \approx 0.1953$  
$P(X = 5) \approx 0.1547$  
​The most probable number is 3.

### (b) What is the probability of two suicides in one week?

## Solution

First, compute the rate for one week. Since there are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month, the rate for one week is:
$\[
\lambda_{\text{week}} = \frac{0.33}{4.33} \approx 0.076
\]$
The probability of two suicides in one week is given by the Poisson distribution:
$\[
P(X = 2) = \frac{(0.076)^2 e^{-0.076}}{2!}
\]$
$P(X = 2) \approx 0.00269$  

## Question 33
Let $F(x) = 1 - e^{-\alpha x^\beta}$ for $x \geq 0$, $\alpha > 0$, and $\beta > 0$. Show that $F$ is a cumulative distribution function (CDF), and find the corresponding probability density function (PDF).

Showing $F(x)$ is a valid CDF:
To prove $F(x)$ is a valid cumulative distribution function (CDF), we need to verify two properties:

1. **Monotonicity**: The function $F(x)$ should be non-decreasing.
   - Since $\( \alpha > 0 \)$ and $\( \beta > 0 \)$, $\( \exp(-\alpha x^\beta) \)$ is decreasing as $x$ increases. Thus, $\( 1 - \exp(-\alpha x^\beta) \)$ is non-decreasing.

2. **Boundary conditions**:
   - $\( \lim_{x \to 0^+} F(x) = F(0) = 0 \)$
   - $\( \lim_{x \to \infty} F(x) = 1 \)$

Hence, $F(x)$ satisfies the conditions of a CDF.

Finding the PDF:
To find the PDF, differentiate $F(x)$ with respect to $x$:
$\[f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( 1 - \exp(-\alpha x^\beta) \right)\]$
$\[f(x) = \alpha \beta x^{\beta - 1} \exp(-\alpha x^\beta), \quad x \geq 0\]$

The PDF is:

$$
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
    \alpha \beta x^{\beta - 1} \exp(-\alpha x^\beta), & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\
    0, & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
$$


## Question 34
Let $f(x) = \frac{1 + \alpha x}{2}$ for $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $-1 \leq \alpha \leq 1$. Show that $f(x)$ is a probability density function, and find the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF). Also, find the quartiles and the median of the distribution in terms of $\alpha$.

## Solution

### 1. Show that $f(x)$ is a valid PDF:

- **Non-negativity**: $\frac{1 + \alpha x}{2} \geq 0$ holds since $-1 \leq \alpha \leq 1$.
- **Total probability**: Integrate $f(x)$ over $[-1, 1]$:
  $\[
  \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1 + \alpha x}{2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} (1 + \alpha x) dx = \frac{1}{2} \left[ x + \frac{\alpha x^2}{2} \right]_{-1}^{1} = 1
  \]$
  Thus, $f(x)$ is a valid PDF.

### 2. Find the CDF:
The CDF $F(x)$ is found by integrating the PDF:
$\[
F(x) = \int_{-1}^{x} f(t) \, dt = \int_{-1}^{x} \frac{1 + \alpha t}{2} \, dt = \frac{1}{2} \left[ (t + \frac{\alpha t^2}{2}) \right]_{-1}^{x}
\]$
This gives:
$\[
F(x) = \frac{1 + \alpha}{2}(x + 1) + \frac{\alpha}{2}(x^2 - 1), \quad -1 \leq x \leq 1
\]$

### 3. Quartiles and Median:
- **Quartiles**: The quartiles $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ satisfy $F(Q_1) = 0.25 \)$ and $\( F(Q_3) = 0.75 \)$.
- **Median**: The median $M$ satisfies $F(M) = 0.5$.

These values are found by solving the respective equations using the CDF $F(x)$.


## Question 35
For a continuous random variable $X$ uniformly distributed over $[-1, 1]$, the PDF is constant over this interval, because each point in the interval has an equal probability of being chosen. The total probability is 1, and the length of the interval is 2. Hence, the PDF is given by:

$$
f_X(x) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{1}{2}, & -1 \leq x \leq 1 \\
0, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

### 2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
The CDF $F_X(x)$ is the integral of the PDF up to $x$. This gives the probability that the random variable $X$ takes a value less than or equal to $x$. The CDF is defined as:

$$
F_X(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f_X(t) \, dt
$$

Thus, the CDF for a Uniform distribution on $[-1, 1]$ is:

$$
F_X(x) = \begin{cases} 
0, & x < -1 \\
\frac{x + 1}{2}, & -1 \leq x \leq 1 \\
1, & x > 1
\end{cases}
$$

### Graphical Representation
- **PDF:** A flat line at $\( \frac{1}{2} \)$ between $-1$ and $1$, and zero elsewhere.
- **CDF:** A straight line from $0$ at $x = -1$ to $1$ at $x = 1$, with a slope of $\( \frac{1}{2} \)$.
