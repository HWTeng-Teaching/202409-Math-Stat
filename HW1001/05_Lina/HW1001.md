## Question 19
Find an expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a geometric random variable.

## Solution

Let $X$ be a geometric random variable with parameter $p$, representing the probability of success in each trial.

For $x < 1$,
\[
F_X(x) = 0
\]

For $1 \leq x < 2$,
$\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) = p
\]$

For $2 \leq x < 3$,
$\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = p + (1 - p)p = p(1 + (1 - p))
\]$

In general, for $k \leq x < k + 1$:
$\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + \dots + P(X = k)
\]$
This becomes:
$\[
F_X(x) = p + (1 - p)p + \dots + (1 - p)^{k - 1} p = \sum_{i=1}^{k} p(1 - p)^{i - 1}
\]$

The sum of this geometric series simplifies to:
$\[
F_X(x) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
\]$
Thus, the CDF of a geometric random variable is:
$\[
F_X(x) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
\]$


## Question 21
If $X$ is a geometric random variable, show that:
$\[
P(X > n + k - 1 \mid X > n - 1) = P(X > k)
\]$

## Solution

This equation demonstrates the **memoryless property** of the geometric distribution. We can start by rewriting the left-hand side as:
$\[
P(X > n + k - 1 \mid X > n - 1) = \frac{P(X > n + k - 1 \cap X > n - 1)}{P(X > n - 1)} = \frac{P(X > n + k - 1)}{P(X > n - 1)}
\]$

Since for a geometric random variable:
$\[
P(X > n) = (1 - p)^n
\]$
Substitute this into the expression:
$\[
P(X > n + k - 1 \mid X > n - 1) = \frac{(1 - p)^{n + k - 1}}{(1 - p)^{n - 1}} = (1 - p)^k = P(X > k)
\]$
Thus, the memoryless property is proven.


## Question 30
Suppose that in a city, the number of suicides can be approximated by a Poisson process with $\lambda = 0.33$ per month.

### (a) Find the probability of $k$ suicides in a year for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$. What is the most probable number of suicides?

## Solution

The rate of suicides per year is:
$\[
\lambda_{\text{year}} = 12 \times 0.33 = 3.96
\]$

The probability mass function for a Poisson random variable with rate $\lambda_{\text{year}}$ is:
$\[
P(X = k) = \frac{(3.96)^k e^{-3.96}}{k!}
\]$
for $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots$.

To find the most probable number of suicides, calculate the probabilities for different values of $k$, and find the mode (the value of $k$ that maximizes $P(X = k)$).

### (b) What is the probability of two suicides in one week?

## Solution

First, compute the rate for one week. Since there are approximately 4.33 weeks in a month, the rate for one week is:
$\[
\lambda_{\text{week}} = \frac{0.33}{4.33} \approx 0.076
\]$
The probability of two suicides in one week is given by the Poisson distribution:
$\[
P(X = 2) = \frac{(0.076)^2 e^{-0.076}}{2!}
\]$
Simplify this expression to get the final probability.


## Question 33
Let $F(x) = 1 - e^{-\alpha x^\beta}$ for $x \geq 0$, $\alpha > 0$, and $\beta > 0$. Show that $F$ is a cumulative distribution function (CDF), and find the corresponding probability density function (PDF).

## Solution

1. **Verify $F(x)$ is a CDF**:
   - For $x \geq 0$, $F(x) = 1 - e^{-\alpha x^\beta}$ is non-decreasing because $e^{-\alpha x^\beta}$ is decreasing.
   - As $x \to 0^+$, $F(x) = 0$, and as $x \to \infty$, $F(x) = 1$.
   - $F(x)$ is right-continuous by definition.

2. **Find the PDF**:
   The PDF is the derivative of the CDF:
    $\[
   f(x) = \frac{d}{dx} F(x) = \alpha \beta x^{\beta - 1} e^{-\alpha x^\beta}
   \]$
   for $x \geq 0$.


## Question 34
Let $f(x) = \frac{1 + \alpha x}{2}$ for $-1 \leq x \leq 1$ and $f(x) = 0$ otherwise, where $-1 \leq \alpha \leq 1$. Show that $f(x)$ is a probability density function, and find the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF). Also, find the quartiles and the median of the distribution in terms of $\alpha$.

## Solution

### 1. Show that $f(x)$ is a valid PDF:

- **Non-negativity**: $\frac{1 + \alpha x}{2} \geq 0$ holds since $-1 \leq \alpha \leq 1$.
- **Total probability**: Integrate $f(x)$ over $[-1, 1]$:
  $\[
  \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1 + \alpha x}{2} dx = \frac{1}{2} \int_{-1}^{1} (1 + \alpha x) dx = \frac{1}{2} \left[ x + \frac{\alpha x^2}{2} \right]_{-1}^{1} = 1
  \]$
  Thus, $f(x)$ is a valid PDF.

### 2. Find the CDF:
$\[
F(x) = \int_{-1}^{x} \frac{1 + \alpha t}{2} dt = \frac{x + \frac{\alpha x^2}{2}}{2} + \frac{1}{2}, \quad -1 \leq x \leq 1
\]$

### 3. Quartiles and Median:
To find the median $x_m$, solve for $F(x_m) = 0.5$:
$\[
\frac{x_m + \frac{\alpha x_m^2}{2}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\]$
Solve for $x_m$, and similarly find the quartiles by solving for $F(x) = 0.25$ and $F(x) = 0.75$.


## Question 35
Sketch the PDF and CDF of a Uniform Random Variable on $[-1, 1]$.

For a uniform random variable $X \sim U[-1, 1]$, the PDF is:

f(x) =  
{ $\frac{1}{2}$ if −1 ≤ x ≤ 1  
{ 0 otherwise
​
The CDF is:
F(x) =  
{ 0 if x < -1  
{ $\frac{x + 1}{2}$ if −1 ≤ x ≤ 1
{ 1 if x > 1
