# Problem 19: Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of a Geometric Random Variable

Let \( X \) be a geometric random variable with parameter \( p \), representing the probability of success in each trial. The probability mass function (PMF) of \( X \) is:
\[
P(X = k) = (1 - p)^{k - 1} p, \quad k = 1, 2, 3, \dots
\]
The CDF is the probability that \( X \leq n \), which is the sum of the probabilities of all outcomes up to \( n \):
\[
F(n) = P(X \leq n) = \sum_{k=1}^{n} (1 - p)^{k - 1} p
\]
This is a geometric series, and we know that the sum of a geometric series \( \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} r^k = \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r} \) for \( |r| < 1 \). Therefore, the CDF can be written as:
\[
F(n) = 1 - (1 - p)^n, \quad n \geq 1
\]
Thus, the CDF of a geometric random variable is:
\[
F(n) = 1 - (1 - p)^n
\]
