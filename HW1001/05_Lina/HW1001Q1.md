## Question 19
Find an expression for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a geometric random variable.

## Solution

Let $X$ be a geometric random variable with parameter $p$, representing the probability of success in each trial.

For $x < 1$,
\[
F_X(x) = 0
\]

For $1 \leq x < 2$,
\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) = p
\]

For $2 \leq x < 3$,
\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) = p + (1 - p)p = p(1 + (1 - p))
\]

In general, for $k \leq x < k + 1$:
\[
F_X(x) = P(X = 1) + P(X = 2) + \dots + P(X = k)
\]
This becomes:
\[
F_X(x) = p + (1 - p)p + \dots + (1 - p)^{k - 1} p = \sum_{i=1}^{k} p(1 - p)^{i - 1}
\]

The sum of this geometric series simplifies to:
\[
F_X(x) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
\]
Thus, the CDF of a geometric random variable is:
\[
F_X(x) = 1 - (1 - p)^k
\]
