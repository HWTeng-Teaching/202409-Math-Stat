## Q2. 

### Questions 

If X is a geometric random variable, show that  
P(X > n + k − 1|X > n − 1) = P(X > k)  
In light of the construction of a geometric distribution from a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, how can this be interpreted so that it is “obvious”?

## Q4. 

### Questions 

Let F(x) = 1 − exp(−αxβ ) for x ≥ 0,α > 0,β > 0, and F(x) = 0 for x < 0.
