## CH2.34
## Let f(x) = (1+αx)/2 for −1 ≤ x ≤ 1 and f(x) = 0 otherwise, where −1 ≤ α ≤ 1. Show that f is a density, and find the corresponding cdf. Find the quartiles and the median of the distribution in terms of α.

## Answer 

f(x) = (1 + alpha * x) / 2   for -1 <= x <= 1
f(x) = 0 otherwise
where -1 <= alpha <= 1.

1. Showing f(x) is a Probability Density Function (PDF)

To prove that f(x) is a valid PDF,
	1.	Non-Negativity: f(x) >= 0 for all x.
	2.	Normalization: the integral of f(x) over its range must be 1.

1.1 Non-Negativity

For x in the interval [-1, 1], we need to check whether f(x) is non-negative:

f(x) = (1 + alpha * x) / 2

	•	When alpha >= 0, the minimum value occurs at x = -1, and f(-1) = (1 - alpha) / 2. Since -1 <= alpha <= 1, we have f(-1) >= 0.
	•	When alpha < 0, the minimum value occurs at x = 1, and f(1) = (1 + alpha) / 2. Again, f(1) >= 0 because -1 <= alpha <= 1.

Thus, f(x) is non-negative for all x.

1.2 Normalization

We need to verify that the integral of f(x) over [-1, 1] equals 1:

Integral from -1 to 1 of (1 + alpha * x) / 2 dx

Breaking it into two parts:

(1/2) * Integral from -1 to 1 of 1 dx + (alpha/2) * Integral from -1 to 1 of x dx

Evaluating both integrals:

	•	The integral of 1 over [-1, 1] is 2.
	•	The integral of x over [-1, 1] is 0.

Thus, the total is:

(1/2) * 2 + (alpha/2) * 0 = 1

This confirms that the total area under f(x) is 1, so f(x) is a valid PDF.

2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

 F(x) is the integral of the PDF from -infinity to x. 

F(x) = 0 for x < -1
F(x) = Integral from -1 to x of (1 + alpha * t) / 2 dt for -1 <= x <= 1
F(x) = 1 for x > 1

=>

F(x) = (x + 1) / 2 + (alpha * (x^2 - 1)) / 4 for -1 <= x <= 1

Thus, the CDF is:

F(x) = 0 for x < -1
F(x) = (x + 1) / 2 + (alpha * (x^2 - 1)) / 4 for -1 <= x <= 1
F(x) = 1 for x > 1

3. Quartiles and Median

To find the quartiles and median, we solve for the values of x that satisfy F(x) = 0.25, F(x) = 0.5, and F(x) = 0.75.

General Formula

For F(x) = p,
(x + 1) / 2 + ( α * (x^2 - 1)) / 4 = p
Simplifying:

x = [-2 + sqrt(4 - 4 * α * (2 - α - 4 * p))] / (2 * α)

Special Case: Uniform Distribution (alpha = 0)

When alpha = 0, the distribution is uniform, and the equation simplifies to:

F(x) = (x + 1) / 2 = p

Solving for x:

x = 2 * p - 1

Thus:

	•	First Quartile (p = 0.25): x = -0.5
	•	Median (p = 0.5): x = 0
	•	Third Quartile (p = 0.75): x = 0.5

General Case for alpha != 0

For alpha != 0, solve the quadratic equation to get the quartiles and median as:

x_p = [-1 + sqrt((1 - alpha)^2 + 4 * alpha * p)] / alpha

Where p = 0.25 for the first quartile, p = 0.5 for the median, and p = 0.75 for the third quartile.
