The **Leibniz integration rule** refers to a method for differentiating an integral whose limits of integration or the integrand depend on a parameter. It provides a systematic way to take the derivative of an integral where the upper and/or lower limits of integration are variable functions.

**General form of Leibniz's rule**:
If we have an integral of the form:

$$
I(z) = \int_{a(z)}^{b(z)} f(z, u) \, du
$$

where $a(z)$ and $b(z)$ are functions of $z$, and $f(z, u)$ is a function of $z$ and $u$, then the derivative of $I(z)$ with respect to $z$ is given by:

$$
\frac{dI(z)}{dz} = f(z, b(z)) \frac{d}{dz}b(z) - f(z, a(z)) \frac{d}{dz}a(z) + \int_{a(z)}^{b(z)} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} f(z, u)du
$$

### Explanation:
- The **first term** $f(z, b(z)) \frac{d}{dz}b(z)$ accounts for the change in the integral's value due to the change in the upper limit $b(z)$.
- The **second term** $-f(z, a(z)) \frac{d}{dz}a(z)$ represents the change due to the change in the lower limit $a(z)$.
- The **third term** $\int_{a(z)}^{b(z)} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} f(z, u)du$ accounts for the direct change in the integrand $f(z, u)$ with respect to $z$ over the interval of integration.
