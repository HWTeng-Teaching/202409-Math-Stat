# Leibniz Integration Rule

The Leibniz rule for integration, also known as the **Leibniz integral rule**, provides a method for differentiating an integral with respect to a parameter. This rule is useful when dealing with integrals where either the limits of integration or the integrand depend on a variable parameter, often denoted by `t`.

The general form of the **Leibniz rule** states that if we have an integral of the form:

    F(t) = ∫[a(t), b(t)] f(x, t) dx

where:
- `f(x, t)` is the integrand that depends on both `x` and `t`,
- `a(t)` and `b(t)` are the variable limits of integration, which also depend on `t`,

then the derivative of `F(t)` with respect to `t` is:

    dF(t)/dt = f(b(t), t) * db(t)/dt - f(a(t), t) * da(t)/dt + ∫[a(t), b(t)] ∂f(x, t)/∂t dx

## Explanation of Terms

1. **Boundary Terms**: The first two terms, `f(b(t), t) * db(t)/dt` and `- f(a(t), t) * da(t)/dt`, account for the contributions from the moving limits of integration. These terms capture the impact of changing the limits of integration on the total value of the integral.

2. **Integral of Partial Derivative**: The third term, `∫[a(t), b(t)] ∂f(x, t)/∂t dx`, represents the contribution from the rate of change of the integrand `f(x, t)` with respect to `t` over the interval `[a(t), b(t)]`.

## When to Use the Leibniz Rule

The Leibniz rule is particularly useful in scenarios such as:
- **Physics and Engineering**: When you need to differentiate an integral with variable limits.
- **Mathematics**: When the integrand depends on an external parameter that changes.

In summary, the Leibniz rule allows for efficient differentiation of integrals where the boundaries or the integrand itself depend on an external variable, making it a powerful tool in calculus and applied mathematics.
