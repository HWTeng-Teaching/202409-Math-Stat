# HW1112 Q7
59. Let X 1 and X 2 be independent standard normal random variables. Show that the
    
joint distribution of

Y 1 = a 11 X 1 + a 12 X 2 + b 1

Y 2 = a 21 X 1 + a 22 X 2 + b 2

is bivariate normal.

# Bivariate Normal Distribution of \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \)

Let \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) be independent standard normal random variables. We are asked to show that the joint distribution of:

$$
Y_1 = a_{11} X_1 + a_{12} X_2 + b_1
$$

and

$$
Y_2 = a_{21} X_1 + a_{22} X_2 + b_2
$$

is bivariate normal.

## Step 1: Express \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \)

The random variables \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) are linear combinations of the independent standard normal random variables \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \):

$$
Y_1 = a_{11} X_1 + a_{12} X_2 + b_1
$$

$$
Y_2 = a_{21} X_1 + a_{22} X_2 + b_2
$$

where \( a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{21}, a_{22} \) are constants, and \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are constants representing shifts or offsets.

## Step 2: Distribution of \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \)

Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent standard normal random variables, their joint distribution is bivariate normal with the following properties:


- $\( X_1 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \)$
- $\( X_2 \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \)$
- $\( \text{Cov}(X_1, X_2) = 0 \)$, since $\( X_1 \)$ and $\( X_2 \)$ are independent.

Thus, the vector \( \mathbf{X} = \begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \end{pmatrix} \) has a mean vector of \( \mathbf{0} \) and a covariance matrix of the identity matrix:

$$
\mathbf{\Sigma}_X = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

## Step 3: The Linear Transformation

The random variables \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) are related to \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) by the following linear transformation:

$$
\begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\ Y_2 \end{pmatrix} =
\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \end{pmatrix}
+
\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Let $\( A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix} \)$ represent the coefficient matrix, and $\( \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix} \)$ represent the shift vector.

## Step 4: Mean of \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \)

Since $\( X_1 \)$ and $\( X_2 \)$ are standard normal random variables with mean 0, the mean of \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) is:

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_1] = a_{11} \mathbb{E}[X_1] + a_{12} \mathbb{E}[X_2] + b_1 = b_1
$$

$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_2] = a_{21} \mathbb{E}[X_1] + a_{22} \mathbb{E}[X_2] + b_2 = b_2
$$

Thus, the mean vector of \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) is:

$$
\mathbf{\mu}_Y = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}
$$

## Step 5: Covariance Matrix of \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \)

To compute the covariance matrix of \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \), we use the following formula for the covariance of a linear transformation:

$$
\Sigma_Y = A \Sigma_X A^T
$$

Since $\( \Sigma_X = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \)$, we have:

$$
\Sigma_Y = A \cdot I \cdot A^T = A A^T
$$

where \( A \) is:

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}
$$

Thus, the covariance matrix $\( \Sigma_Y \)$ is:

$$
A A^T = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}
$$

Carrying out the matrix multiplication:

$$
A A^T = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}^2 + a_{12}^2 & a_{11}a_{21} + a_{12}a_{22} \\
a_{11}a_{21} + a_{12}a_{22} & a_{21}^2 + a_{22}^2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Thus, the covariance matrix of $\( Y_1 \)$ and $\( Y_2 \)$ is:

$$
\Sigma_Y = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}^2 + a_{12}^2 & a_{11}a_{21} + a_{12}a_{22} \\
a_{11}a_{21} + a_{12}a_{22} & a_{21}^2 + a_{22}^2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

## Step 6: Conclusion

The random vector

$$
\( \begin{pmatrix} Y_1 \\ Y_2 \end{pmatrix} \)
$$

is a linear transformation of the independent normal random variables 

$$
\( \begin{pmatrix} X_1 \\ X_2 \end{pmatrix} \)
$$

. Since any linear transformation of a multivariate normal vector results in another multivariate normal vector, it follows that the joint distribution of \( Y_1 \) and \( Y_2 \) is bivariate normal.

Thus, the joint distribution of $\( Y_1 \)$ and $\( Y_2 \)$ is bivariate normal with mean vector:

$$
\mathbf{\mu}_Y = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \end{pmatrix}
$$

and covariance matrix:

$$
\Sigma_Y = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11}^2 + a_{12}^2 & a_{11}a_{21} + a_{12}a_{22} \\
a_{11}a_{21} + a_{12}a_{22} & a_{21}^2 + a_{22}^2
\end{pmatrix}
$$

# Problem 60: Generating Pseudorandom Variables with a Bivariate Normal Distribution

This question asks for a method to generate pseudorandom variables that follow a bivariate normal distribution from independent pseudorandom uniform variables. The method we will use is based on the **Box-Muller transform**, which is a common technique to generate normal random variables from uniform random variables.

### Steps to Generate Bivariate Normal Variables

#### Step 1: Start with Two Independent Uniform Random Variables
Let $U_1$ and $U_2$ be two independent random variables, each uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, 1]$. These are the input random variables.

#### Step 2: Apply the Box-Muller Transform to Generate Standard Normal Variables

The Box-Muller transform converts the two uniform random variables $U_1$ and $U_2$ into two independent standard normal random variables $Z_1$ and $Z_2$. The transformation is defined as:

$$
Z_1 = \sqrt{-2 \ln(U_1)} \cos(2 \pi U_2)
$$
$$
Z_2 = \sqrt{-2 \ln(U_1)} \sin(2 \pi U_2)
$$

The random variables $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are independent and each follows a standard normal distribution, i.e., $Z_1, Z_2 \sim N(0, 1)$.

#### Step 3: Scale and Shift the Normal Variables to Obtain the Desired Bivariate Normal Distribution

Now, we need to transform $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ into the desired bivariate normal variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$. If we want $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ to have means $b_1$ and $b_2$, and covariance matrix given by:

$$
\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix} \sigma_1^2 & \rho \sigma_1 \sigma_2 \\ \rho \sigma_1 \sigma_2 & \sigma_2^2 \end{pmatrix}
$$

then we use a linear transformation:

$$
Y_1 = a_{11} Z_1 + a_{12} Z_2 + b_1
$$
$$
Y_2 = a_{21} Z_1 + a_{22} Z_2 + b_2
$$

Where the coefficients $a_{11}, a_{12}, a_{21}, a_{22}$ are chosen based on the desired covariance matrix. Specifically, they are determined as follows:

1. **Variances**: 
   - $\sigma_1^2 = a_{11}^2 + a_{12}^2$
   - $\sigma_2^2 = a_{21}^2 + a_{22}^2$

2. **Covariance**: 
   - $\text{Cov}(Y_1, Y_2) = a_{11} a_{21} + a_{12} a_{22} = \rho \sigma_1 \sigma_2$

This ensures that the transformed variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ follow a bivariate normal distribution with the desired means and covariance.

### Summary of the Method:

1. **Generate two independent uniform random variables** $U_1$ and $U_2$ on the interval $[0, 1]$.
2. **Use the Box-Muller transform** to convert $U_1$ and $U_2$ into two independent standard normal random variables $Z_1$ and $Z_2$:
   $$
   Z_1 = \sqrt{-2 \ln(U_1)} \cos(2 \pi U_2), \quad Z_2 = \sqrt{-2 \ln(U_1)} \sin(2 \pi U_2)
   $$
3. **Apply the linear transformation** to $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ to obtain the desired bivariate normal variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$:
   $$
   Y_1 = a_{11} Z_1 + a_{12} Z_2 + b_1, \quad Y_2 = a_{21} Z_1 + a_{22} Z_2 + b_2
   $$

Thus, the pair $(Y_1, Y_2)$ will follow a bivariate normal distribution with the specified means and covariance matrix.

### Important Notes:
- If $a_{12} = a_{21}$, then the two variables $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are correlated. If they are uncorrelated, set $a_{12} = a_{21} = 0$.
- The covariance matrix of $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ will be determined by the matrix $\mathbf{A} = \begin{pmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} \end{pmatrix}$ and the variances of $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, which are both 1 because $Z_1, Z_2 \sim N(0,1)$.

This method is efficient and widely used in simulations where bivariate normal data needs to be generated from uniformly distributed random variables.
