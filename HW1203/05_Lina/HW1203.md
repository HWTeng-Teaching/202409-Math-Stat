## Q1
### Question
The number of insurance claims, $N$, filed in a year is Poisson distributed with $E(N) = 10,000$. Use the normal approximation to the Poisson to approximate $P(N > 10,200)$.

### Solution
1. The Poisson random variable $N$ can be approximated by a normal distribution:
   
   $N \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 10,000, \sigma^2 = 10,000)$
   
   where

   $\sigma = \sqrt{\mu} = \sqrt{10,000} = 100$.

3. Compute the $Z$-score for $N = 10,200$:
   
   $Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{10,200 - 10,000}{100} = 2$

4. Using the standard normal distribution table:
   
   $P(Z > 2) = 1 - P(Z \leq 2) = 1 - 0.9772 = 0.0228$

5. **Final Answer**:
   
   $P(N > 10,200) \approx 0.0228$

## Q2
### Question
The number of traffic accidents, $N$, in a given period is Poisson distributed with $E(N) = 100$. Use the normal approximation to find $\Delta$ such that $P(100 - \Delta < N < 100 + \Delta) \approx 0.9$.

### Solution
1. The Poisson random variable $N$ can be approximated by a normal distribution:
   
   $N \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 100, \sigma^2 = 100)$

   where

   $\sigma = \sqrt{\mu} = \sqrt{100} = 10$ .

3. Find $\Delta$ such that:
   
   $P\left(-\frac{\Delta}{\sigma} < Z < \frac{\Delta}{\sigma}\right) \approx 0.9$

4. From the standard normal table, for $P(-Z < Z < Z) = 0.9$, the critical $Z$-value is:
   
   $Z = 1.645$

5. Solve for $\Delta$:
   
   $\frac{\Delta}{10} = 1.645 \implies \Delta = 1.645 \times 10 = 16.45$

6. **Final Answer**:

   $\Delta \approx 16.45$

## Q3
### Part 1: Probability a six turns up between 15 and 20 times
1. Define
   
   $X \sim \text{Binomial}(n=100, p=\frac{1}{6})$.
   
3. Use normal approximation:

   $\mu = 16.67, \sigma = 3.73$.
   
5. Standardize
   $P(14.5 \leq X \leq 20.5)$:
   
   $Z_1 = \frac{14.5 - 16.67}{3.73} = -0.58, \quad Z_2 = \frac{20.5 - 16.67}{3.73} = 1.03$
   
7. Probability:
   
   $P(15 < X < 20) = P(-0.58 \leq Z \leq 1.03) = 0.5675$

### Part 2: Probability the sum is less than 300
1. Define $Y$, the sum of face values:
   
   $\mu_Y = 350, \sigma_Y = 17.08$
   
3. Standardize $P(Y < 300)$:
   
   $Z = \frac{300 - 350}{17.08} = -2.93$
   
5. Probability:
   
   $P(Y < 300) = 0.0017$

## Q4
## Problem Description
A drunkard executes a "random walk" as follows:
- Each minute, he takes a step north or south with equal probability $\frac{1}{2}$.
- Each step is 50 cm, and the directions of successive steps are independent.
- The goal is to approximate the probability distribution of his location after 1 hour (60 minutes) using the Central Limit Theorem and determine where he is most likely to be.

---

## Solution
### Step 1: Define the Problem
The total displacement $S$ after 1 hour (60 steps) is the sum of 60 independent steps:

$S = \sum_{i=1}^{60} X_i$

where:
- $X_i = 50$ (step north) with $P(X_i = 50) = \frac{1}{2}$,
- $X_i = -50$ (step south) with $P(X_i = -50) = \frac{1}{2}$.

### Step 2: Calculate Mean and Variance
For a single step $X_i$:

$\mu_{X_i} = E(X_i) = (50) \cdot \frac{1}{2} + (-50) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 0$


$\sigma_{X_i}^2 = \text{Var}(X_i) = E(X_i^2) - (E(X_i))^2 = (50^2) \cdot \frac{1}{2} + ((-50)^2) \cdot \frac{1}{2} - 0^2 = 2500$


Since $S = \sum_{i=1}^{60} X_i$, the mean and variance of $S$ are:

$\mu_S = 60 \cdot \mu_{X_i} = 60 \cdot 0 = 0$


$\sigma_S^2 = 60 \cdot \sigma_{X_i}^2 = 60 \cdot 2500 = 150,000 \quad \implies \quad \sigma_S = \sqrt{150,000} = 387.3 \, \text{cm}$


### Step 3: Apply the Central Limit Theorem
By the Central Limit Theorem, the total displacement $S$ is approximately normally distributed:

$S \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu = 0, \sigma^2 = 387.3^2)$


### Step 4: Determine the Most Likely Position
The most likely position of the drunkard after 1 hour is the mean of the distribution:

$\text{Most likely position: } S = 0 \, \text{cm}$


This result means the drunkard is most likely to be at his starting point after 1 hour.

---

## Final Answer
- The probability distribution of the drunkard's location after 1 hour is:
  
  $S \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 387.3^2)$
  
- The drunkard is most likely to be at:
  
  $S = 0 \, \text{cm (his starting point)}.$

## Q5
### Question
Suppose that you bet $5 on each of a sequence of 50 independent fair games. Use the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to approximate the probability that you will lose more than $75.

### Solution
1. **Step 1**: Define the random variable $X$ representing the net gain from one game:
   - The outcomes are:
     - Win: Gain $5 with probability $\frac{1}{2}$,
     - Lose: Lose $5 with probability $\frac{1}{2}$.
   - Hence, $X \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p = 0.5)$.

2. **Step 2**: Let $S$ represent the total gain over 50 games:
   
   $S = \sum_{i=1}^{50} X_i$
   
   The expected value and variance of $S$ are:
   
   $\mu_S = 50 \cdot \mu_X = 50 \cdot 0 = 0$
   
   
   $\sigma_S^2 = 50 \cdot \sigma_X^2 = 50 \cdot (25) = 1250 \quad \implies \quad \sigma_S = \sqrt{1250} \approx 35.36$
   

4. **Step 3**: Find $P(S < -75)$:
   - Standardize $S$ using $Z = \frac{S - \mu_S}{\sigma_S}$:
     
     $Z = \frac{-75 - 0}{35.36} \approx -2.12$
     

5. **Step 4**: Use the standard normal table to find $P(Z < -2.12)$:
   
   $P(Z < -2.12) \approx 0.017$
  

6. **Final Answer**:
   
   $P(\text{Lose more than \$75}) \approx 0.017$

## Q6
### Question
Suppose that $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_{20}$ are independent random variables with the density function:

$f(x) = 2x, \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1$

Let $S = X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_{20}$. Use the Central Limit Theorem to approximate $P(S \leq 10)$.

### Solution
1. **Step 1**: Calculate the mean and variance of $X$:
   - Mean:
     
     $\mu_X = \int_0^1 x \cdot 2x \, dx = \int_0^1 2x^2 \, dx = \left[ \frac{2x^3}{3} \right]_0^1 = \frac{2}{3}$     
   - Variance:
     
     $\sigma_X^2 = E(X^2) - (E(X))^2$
     
     Compute $E(X^2)$:
     
     $E(X^2) = \int_0^1 x^2 \cdot 2x \, dx = \int_0^1 2x^3 \, dx = \left[ \frac{2x^4}{4} \right]_0^1 = \frac{1}{2}$
     
     Thus:
     
     $\sigma_X^2 = \frac{1}{2} - \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{1}{18}$
     

2. **Step 2**: Calculate the mean and variance of $S$:
   
   $\mu_S = 20 \cdot \mu_X = 20 \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{40}{3} \approx 13.33$
   
   
   $\sigma_S^2 = 20 \cdot \sigma_X^2 = 20 \cdot \frac{1}{18} = \frac{10}{9} \quad \implies \quad \sigma_S = \sqrt{\frac{10}{9}} \approx 1.054$
   

3. **Step 3**: Standardize $S$ to approximate $P(S \leq 10)$:
   
   $Z = \frac{S - \mu_S}{\sigma_S} = \frac{10 - 13.33}{1.054} \approx -3.16$
   

4. **Step 4**: Use the standard normal table to find $P(Z \leq -3.16)$:
   
   $P(Z \leq -3.16) \approx 0.0008$
   

5. **Final Answer**:
   
   $P(S \leq 10) \approx 0.0008$

## Q7
### Question
Suppose that a measurement has mean \( \mu \) and variance \( \sigma^2 = 25 \). Let \( \bar{X} \) be the average of \( n \) such independent measurements. How large should \( n \) be so that:
\[
P(|\bar{X} - \mu| < 1) = 0.95
\]

### Solution
1. **Step 1**: The distribution of the sample mean \( \bar{X} \) is:
   \[
   \bar{X} \sim \mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right)
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{n}}
   \]

2. **Step 2**: Convert the probability statement to the standard normal distribution:
   \[
   P(|\bar{X} - \mu| < 1) = P\left(-1 \leq \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}} \leq 1\right)
   \]
   Standardize:
   \[
   P\left(-\frac{1}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}} \leq Z \leq \frac{1}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}}\right) = 0.95
   \]

3. **Step 3**: From the standard normal table, \( P(-Z \leq Z \leq Z) = 0.95 \) implies \( Z = 1.96 \).

4. **Step 4**: Solve for \( n \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sigma_{\bar{X}}} = 1.96 \quad \implies \quad \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \frac{1}{1.96}
   \]
   Substitute \( \sigma_{\bar{X}} = \sqrt{\frac{25}{n}} \):
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{25}{n}} = \frac{1}{1.96} \quad \implies \quad \frac{25}{n} = \frac{1}{1.96^2}
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{25 \cdot 1.96^2}{1} \approx 96.04
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   \[
   n \approx 97
   \]
