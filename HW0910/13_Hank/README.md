## Q1

### a. List the sample space.

The sample space consists of all possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times. Each outcome can be represented as a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T):

S = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}

### b. List the elements that make up the following events:

1. \( A = at least two heads \)

A = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH\}


2. \( B = the first two tosses are heads \)
   
B = \{HHH, HHT\}


3. \( C = the last toss is a tail \)

C = \{HHT, HTT, THT, TTT\}

### c. List the elements of the following events:

  Aá¶œ = \{THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}  
   A &#8745; B = \{HHH, HHT\}  
   A &#8746; C = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTT\}
