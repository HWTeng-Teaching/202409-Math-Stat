## Q1

### a. List the sample space.

   The sample space consists of all possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times. Each outcome can be represented as a sequence of heads (H)     and tails (T):

   S = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}

### b. List the elements that make up the following events:

   1. \( A = at least two heads \)

   A = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH\}


   2. \( B = the first two tosses are heads \)
   
   B = \{HHH, HHT\}


   3. \( C = the last toss is a tail \)

   C = \{HHT, HTT, THT, TTT\}

### c. List the elements of the following events:

   Aá¶œ = \{THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}  
   A &#8745; B = \{HHH, HHT\}  
   A &#8746; C = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTT\}
   
## Q15
   There will be 4\*6*3=72 kind of meals

## Q27
   total possible outcomes: $26^5$

   the number of favorable outcomes (with no repeated letters) is: 26\*25\*24\*23\*22

   The probability p is: 

   $\frac{26 \times 25 \times 24 \times 23 \times 22}{26^5}$

## Prove: if A $\in$ B, P(A) $\le$ P(B)
