## Problem 1

### a. List the sample space.

The sample space consists of all possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times. Each outcome can be represented as a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T):

\[
S = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}
\]

### b. List the elements that make up the following events:

1. \( A = at least two heads \)


\[
A = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH\}
\]

2. \( B = the first two tosses are heads \)

\[
B = \{HHH, HHT\}
\]

3. \( C = the last toss is a tail \)

\[
C = \{HHT, HTT, THT, TTT\}
\]

### c. List the elements of the following events:

1. \( A^c \) (the complement of event A)

The complement of event \( A \) includes all sequences that do not have at least two heads:

\[
A^c = \{HTT, THT, TTH, TTT\}
\]

2. \( A \cap B \) (the intersection of A and B)

The intersection of \( A \) and \( B \) includes all sequences that are common to both events \( A \) and \( B \):

\[
A \cap B = \{HHH, HHT\}
\]

3. \( A \cup C \) (the union of A and C)

The union of \( A \) and \( C \) includes all sequences that are in either \( A \) or \( C \) (or both):

\[
A \cup C = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTT\}
\]
