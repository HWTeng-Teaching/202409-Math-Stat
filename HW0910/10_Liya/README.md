## a) List the sample space.

When a coin is tossed three times, the sample space \( S \) consist of HEAD (H) and TAILS (T)

So,


S = { HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT }

## b) List the elements that make up the following events: (1) A = at least two heads, (2) B = the first two tosses are heads, (3) C = the last toss is a tail.
(1) A = { HHH, HHT, HTH, THH }
(2) B = { HHH, HHT }
(3) C = { HHT, HTH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT }

## c) List the elements of the following events: (1) A^c, (2) A ∩ B, (3) A ∪ C.
1) A^c = { HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT }
2) A ∩ B = { HHH, HHT }
3) A ∪ C = { HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT }
