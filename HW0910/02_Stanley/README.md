### 1.A coin is tossed three times and the sequence of heads and tails is recorded. a. List the sample space. b. List the elements that make up the following events: (1) A = at least two heads, (2) B = the first two tosses are heads, (3) C = the last toss is a tail. c. List the elements of the following events: (1) Aᶜ, (2) A ∩ B, (3) A ∪ C. 
a.   
Ω= {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}   
b.  
(1) A = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}  
(2) B = {HHT, HHH}  
(3) C = {HHT, HTT, THT, TTT}  
c.  
(1) Aᶜ = {THH, THT, TTH, TTT}  
(2) A ∩ B = {HHH, HHT}  
(3) A ∪ C = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTT}  
### 15.How many different meals can be made from four kinds of meat, six vegetables, and three starches if a meal consists of one selection from each group?  
we need to multiply the number of options in each category  
4×6×3=72  
### 27.If a five-letter word is formed at random (meaning that all sequences of five letters are equally likely), what is the probability that no letter occurs more than once?  
26 English letters →total 26^5 possible words  
no letter is the same so 26×25×24×23×22 possiable words  
26×25×24×23×22/26^5 =303600 /456976 ≈ 0.664  
### Prove: If A ⊆ B, then P(A) ≤ P(B)  
Let ( P(A) ) denote the probability of event ( A ) and Let ( P(B) ) denote the probability of event ( B )  
B = A ∪ (B ∖ A)  
P(B) = P(A) + P(B ∖ A) since they are disjoint  
P(B ∖ A) ≥ 0  
P(B) = P(A) + P(B ∖ A) ≥ P(A)  
then P(A) ≤ P(B)  
### 37.What is the coefficient of $$\(x^2 y^2 z^3)$$ in the Expansion of $$\(x + y + z)^7$$?  
sum of exponents is 7  
exponents of x is 2,exponents of y is 2,exponents of z is 3  
7! / (2! 2! 3!) = 5040 / (2 × 2 × 6) = 210  
the answer is 210
