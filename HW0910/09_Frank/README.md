## Q1. 
### Questions 
A coin is tossed three times and the sequence of heads and tails is recorded.
a. List the sample space.
b. List the elements that make up the following events: (1) A = at least two
heads, (2) B = the first two tosses are heads, (3) C = the last toss is a tail. c. List the elements of the following events: (1) $A^{c}$, (2) A ∩ B, (3) A ∪ C.
### Answers
a.   
   $\Omega$ = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT\}  
  
b.  
   $A^{c}$= \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH\}  
   B = \{HHH, HHT\}  
   C = \{HHT, THT, HTT, TTT\}
## Q2.
### Questions

### Answers
Multiply the number of options from each group  
4×6×3=72
the answer is 72
## Q3.
### Questions
If a five-letter word is formed at random (meaning that all sequences of five letters are equally likely), what is the probability that no letter occurs more than once?  
### Answers
26 English letters fromigng a 5 lettets word → total 26^5 possible words  
no letter is the same in the 5 letters word → 26×25×24×23×22 possiable words  
$26×25×24×23×22 \over 26^{5}$ = $303600 \over 456976$ ≈ 0.664
the answer is 0.664
## Q4.
### Questions
Prove: If A ⊆ B, then P(A) ≤ P(B)  
### Answers
Let P(A) denote the probability of event A and let P(B) denote the probability of event B  
B = A ∪ (B∖A)
P(A) + P(B∖A) = P(B) since A and B∖A are disjoint  
P(B∖A) ≥ 0  
thus P(A) ≤ P(B)  
## Q5.
### Questions
What is the coefficient of $$\(x^2 y^2 z^3)$$ in the Expansion of $$\(x + y + z)^7$$?  
### Answers
sum of exponents is 7  
exponents of x,y,z are 2,2, and 3 respectively  
$7! \over (2! \times 2! \times 3!)$ = $5040 \over (2 \times 2 \times 6)$ = 210  
the answer is 210
