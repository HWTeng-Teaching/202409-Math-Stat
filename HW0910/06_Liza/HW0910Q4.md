## Question 4
Prove: If A ∈ B, P(A) ≤ P(B)

## Solution
A ∈ B implies that  
<br>
B = $A \cup (B \cap A^c)$  
<br>
But $A \cup (B \cap A^c) = \emptyset$
So the events A and B \cap A^c are mutually exclusive, then, by the third axiom  
<br>
$P(B) =  P(A) + P(B \cap A^c)$  
<br>
and thus  
<br>
$P(A) = P(B) - P(B \cap A^c) ≤ P(B)$  
<br>
Hence   
<br>
P(A) ≤ P(B)
<br>
