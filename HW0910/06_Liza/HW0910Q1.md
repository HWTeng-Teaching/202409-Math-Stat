## Question 1

A coin is tossed three times and the sequence of heads and tails is recorded.

**a**. List the sample space.  
**b**. List the elements that make up the following events: (1) *A* = at least two heads, (2) *B* = the first two tosses are heads, (3) *C* = the last toss is a tail.  
**c**. List the elements of the following events: (1) $A^c$, (2) $A \cap B$, (3) $A \cup C$

## Solution  
## Part A
When a coin is tossed three times, the possible outcomes are sequences of heads (H) and tails (T). The sample space $\Omega$ is the set of all these possible outcomes:  
<div align="center">
   Ω = {HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}  
</div>


## Part B
(1) The event that during tossing three times at least two heads is recorded is the subset of $\Omega$ denoted by  

<div align="center">
A = <i>{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}</i>
</div>  
<br>

(2) The event that during tossing three times the first two tosses are heads is the subset of $\Omega$ denoted by  

<div align="center">
B = <i>{HHH, HHT}</i>
</div>  
<br>

(3) The event that during tossing three times the last toss is a tail is the subset of $\Omega$ denoted by  
<div align="center">
C = <i>{HHT, HTT, THT, TTT}</i>
</div>  
<br>

## Part C
(1) $A^c$  is the event that A does not occur and thus consists of all those elements in the sample space that are not in A. he complement of the event that at least two heads are recorded is the event that fewer than two heads are recorded:  

<div align="center">
A<i><sup>c</sup></i> = <i>{HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}</i>
</div>  
<br>

(2) The intersection of two events, $A \cap B$, is the event that both A and B occur. If A is the event that at least two heads are recorded and B is the event that the first two tosses are heads, then $A \cap B$ is the event that at least two heads are recorded and the first two tosses are heads. Thus, C consists of those outcomes that are common to both A and B:  

<div align="center">
A ∩ B = <i>{HHH, HHT}</i>
</div>  
<br>

(3) The union of two events, A and C, is the event C that either A occurs or B occurs or both occur: $A \cup C$. For example, if A is the event that  the event that at least two heads are recorded (listed before), and if C is the event that the last toss is a tail, then $A \cup C$ is the event that either at least two heads are recorded, or the last toss is a tail, or both: 
<div align="center">
A ∪ C = <i>{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}</i>
</div>  
<br>
