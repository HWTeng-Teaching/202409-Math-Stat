## Question 3
If a five-letter word is formed at random (meaning that all sequences of five letters are equally likely), what is the probability that no letter occurs more than once?

## Solution
Call the desired event A;  
$\Omega$ consists of  
<br>
26 × 26 × 26 × 26 × 26 = 11881376
<br>  
possible outcomes.  
<br>
The probability of A is the ratio of the number of ways that A can occur to the total number of possible outcomes.  
There are 26 choices for the first letter, 25 for the second, 24 for the third, and hence  
<br>
26 × 25 × 24 × 23 × 22 = 7893600
<br>  
ways to choose the letters without duplication.   
<br>
The probability of A is thus  
$P(A) = 7893600/11881376 $= 1.387 × 10^11
