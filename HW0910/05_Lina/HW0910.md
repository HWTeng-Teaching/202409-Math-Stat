### Problem 1: Coin Tossed Three Times

#### (a) List the sample space.
The sample space $S$ represents all possible outcomes when a coin is tossed three times. Each outcome can either be heads (H) or tails (T), and thus the sample space is:

$S = $\{ (H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (H, T, T), (T, H, H), (T, H, T), (T, T, H), (T, T, T) \$}

#### (b) List the elements of the following events:
- $A =$ "at least two heads":
  $A = $\{ (H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (T, H, H) \}$

- $B =$ "the first two tosses are heads":
  $B = $\{ (H, H, H), (H, H, T) \}$ 

- $C =$ "the last toss is a tail":
  $C = $\{ (H, H, T), (H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, T) \}$

#### (c) List the elements of the following events:
1. $A^c$ (the complement of $A$):
   $A^c = $\{ (H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, H), (T, T, T) \}$

2. $A \cap B$ (intersection of $A$ and $B$):
   $A \cap B = $\{ (H, H, H), (H, H, T) \}$

3. $A \cup C$ (union of $A$ and $C$):
   $$
   A \cup C = \{ (H, H, H), (H, H, T), (H, T, H), (T, H, H), (H, T, T), (T, H, T), (T, T, T) \}
   $$

### Problem 15: How many different meals can be made from four kinds of meat, six vegetables, and three starches?

Since a meal consists of one selection from each group, the total number of possible meals is the product of the number of choices in each group:

$$
4 \times 6 \times 3 = 72
$$

Thus, 72 different meals can be made.

### Problem 27: Probability of Forming a Five-Letter Word with No Repeated Letters

There are 26 letters in the alphabet. For a five-letter word with no repeated letters, the number of ways to choose the letters is:

$$
26 \times 25 \times 24 \times 23 \times 22 = 7,893,600
$$

The total number of possible five-letter sequences (without restriction) is:

$$
26^5 = 11,881,376
$$

Therefore, the probability of no repeated letters is:

$$
\frac{7,893,600}{11,881,376} \approx 0.6646
$$

### Prove: If $A \subseteq B$, then $P(A) \leq P(B)$

**Proof:**

If $A \subseteq B$, then by the definition of a subset, every outcome in $A$ is also in $B$. Therefore, the probability of $A$ occurring cannot exceed the probability of $B$ occurring. Mathematically:

$$
P(A) = P(A \cap B) \leq P(B)
$$

Thus, $P(A) \leq P(B)$.

### Problem 33: Probability That No Two People Get Off at the Same Floor

We have 5 people and 7 floors, and we want the probability that no two people get off on the same floor.

The number of ways to assign each of the 5 people to a unique floor is:

$$
7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 = 2,520
$$

The total number of ways to assign each of the 5 people to any floor (with repetitions allowed) is:

$$
7^5 = 16,807
$$

Thus, the probability that no two people get off at the same floor is:

$$
\frac{2,520}{16,807} \approx 0.1499
$$

### Problem 37: Coefficient of $x^2 y^2 z^3$ in the Expansion of $(x + y + z)^7$

1. **Total Power**:  
   The expansion of $$\(x + y + z)^7$$ requires that the sum of the exponents in each term must equal 7.
    - That is:  
   $$\(a + b + c = 7)$$  
   where $$\(a)$$ is the exponent of $$\(x)$$, $$\(b)$$ is the exponent of $$\(y)$$, and $$\(c)$$ is the exponent of $$\(z)$$.

2. **For the term $$\(x^2 y^2 z^3)$$**:  
   The exponents for $$\(x)$$, $$\(y)$$, and $$\(z)$$ are $$\(a = 2)$$, $$\(b = 2)$$, and $$\(c = 3)$$, respectively.
   So, we want to find the coefficient of this specific term.

3. **Coefficient Using Combinations**:  
   The coefficient is found using the multinomial formula:
   
   $$\[ \frac{7!}{2!2!3!}]$$

5. **Calculation**:  
   First, calculate the factorials:  

   $$\[7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040]$$
     
   $$\[2! = 2 \times 1 = 2]$$
     
   $$\[3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6]$$
     
   Now substitute into the formula:  
   $$\[\frac{7!}{2!2!3!} = \frac{5040}{2 \times 2 \times 6} = \frac{5040}{24} = 210]$$

Thus, the coefficient of $$\(x^2 y^2 z^3)$$ is **210**.

### Prove: $P(\varnothing) = 0$

**Proof:**

The empty set $\varnothing$ contains no elements, so the event $\varnothing$ cannot occur. Therefore, its probability is defined as:

$$
P(\varnothing) = 0
$$

### Prove: $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$

**Proof:**

By the definition of probability and the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

$$
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
$$

This formula corrects for the fact that $P(A \cap B)$ is counted twice when adding $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.
